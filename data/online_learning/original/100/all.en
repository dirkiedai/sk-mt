What is Levemir ?
Levemir is a clear colourless solution for injection .
It is available in a cartridge ( PenFill ) or in a prefilled pen ( FlexPen and InnoLet ) .
Levemir contains the active ingredient insulin detemir .
What is Levemir used for ?
Levemir is used to treat patients ( adults and children over the age of 6 ) who have diabetes .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Levemir used ?
Levemir is administered subcutaneously ( under the skin ) by injection in the abdominal wall ( tummy ) , the thigh , or the upper arm .
Levemir is a long-acting insulin .
It can be used in the following ways : • once a day as an add-on to oral anti-diabetes medicines .
The dose should be adjusted according to the individual patients &quot; blood glucose levels , • in combination with injections at mealtimes of a short- or rapid-acting insulin .
It should be given once or twice a day depending on patients &quot; needs .
The patient &quot; s blood glucose should be regularly tested to find the lowest effective dose .
How does Levemir work ?
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar .
Levemir is a replacement insulin which is very similar to the insulin made by the pancreas . The active ingredient of Levemir , insulin detemir , is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology . &quot;
It is made by a yeast that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce insulin detemir .
Insulin detemir is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it is absorbed more slowly by the body , and takes longer to reach its target in the body .
This means that Levemir has a long duration of action .
The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood .
How has Levemir been studied ?
Levemir has been studied in 1,575 patients with type 1 diabetes , when the pancreas cannot produce insulin , and over 2,400 patients with type 2 diabetes , when the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
The studies compared Levemir to human insulin NPH ( an intermediate-acting insulin ) or to insulin glargine ( a long-acting insulin ) .
The medicines were given as once or twice daily injections .
Injections of fast-acting insulin were also used at mealtimes .
In four of the six studies in type 2 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

All studies measured the level of glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled .
What benefit has Levemir shown during the studies ?
The studies showed that Levemir controls HbA1c in a similar manner to insulin NPH , with less risk of low blood glucose level during the night and no associated weight gain .
In combination with oral anti- diabetes medicines , Levemir also controlled HbA1c in a similar manner to insulin glargine .
What is the risk associated with Levemir ?
The most common side effects when taking Levemir ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) and injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) .
In patients also taking oral anti-diabetes medicines , a common side effect is signs of allergy .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Levemir , see the Package Leaflet .
Levemir should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive to insulin detemir or any of the other ingredients .
Levemir doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar ( the full list is available in the Package Leaflet ) .
Why has Levemir been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Levemir &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes mellitus . They recommended that Levemir be given marketing authorisation .
Other information about Levemir :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Levemir to Novo Nordisk A / S on 1 June 2004 .

What is Humira ?
Humira is a medicine containing the active substance adalimumab .
It is available as a solution for injection in a vial , pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen , all containing 40 mg adalimumab .
What is Humira used for ?
Humira is an anti-inflammatory medicine .
It is used to treat the following groups of patients : • adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis ( an immune system disease causing inflammation of the joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments , and adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis that is progressive ( getting worse ) who have not taken methotrexate ( another medicine that acts on the immune system ) before .
Humira is used in combination with methotrexate , or on its own in patients who cannot take methotrexate ; • adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( an immune system disease affecting children and adolescents that causes inflammation of at least five joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments .
Humira is used in combination with methotrexate , or on its own in patients who cannot take methotrexate ; • adults with active and progressive psoriatic arthritis ( a disease causing red , scaly patches on the skin and inflammation of the joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis ( a disease causing inflammation and pain in the joints of the spine ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with severe active Crohn &quot; s disease ( a disease causing inflammation of the gut ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with psoriasis ( a disease causing red , scaly patches on the skin ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments . See the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) for full details . The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Humira used ? Treatment with Humira must be initiated and supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the diseases that Humira is used to treat . The recommended dose is 40 mg given every two weeks as an injection under the skin , but for Crohn &quot; s disease and psoriasis , an initial dose of 80 mg is given , followed by 40 mg every two weeks . Patients who need a more rapid response for Crohn &quot; s disease may need to start with two higher doses 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

( 160 mg followed by 80 mg ) , although this might increase the risk of side effects .
Patients may be given other medicines during treatment with Humira , such as corticosteroids ( other anti-inflammatory medicines ) .
After training , patients may inject themselves with Humira if their doctor agrees .
Patients who take Humira must be given the special alert card that summarises the safety information about the medicine .
For more information , see the Package Leaflet .
How does Humira work ?
The active substance in Humira , adalimumab , is a monoclonal antibody .
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody ( a type of protein ) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure ( called an antigen ) that is found in the body .
Adalimumab has been designed to bind to a chemical messenger in the body called tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) .
This messenger is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that Humira is used to treat .
By blocking TNF , adalimumab reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases .
How has Humira been studied ?
Humira has been studied in five studies of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis .
In four of these studies , the effectiveness of Humira , alone or as an as add-on to other anti-inflammatory medicines including methotrexate , was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in over 2,000 patients .
The fifth study compared the combination of Humira and methotrexate to methotrexate or to Humira alone in 799 patients who had not taken methotrexate before .
For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , Humira was compared with placebo , alone or as an add- on to methotrexate , in one main study involving 171 patients aged between four and 17 years .
All of the patients received Humira for 16 weeks before being assigned to Humira or placebo for a further 32 weeks .
For psoriatic arthritis , Humira was compared with placebo over 12 weeks in two studies including 413 patients .
The medicines were taken alone or in combination with another anti-inflammatory medicine .
For ankylosing spondylitis , Humira and placebo as an add-on to existing treatment were compared over 12 weeks in two studies involving 397 patients .
For Crohn &quot; s disease , the effectiveness of the first two doses of Humira ( induction ) was compared with that of placebo in two studies involving 624 patients over four weeks .
Another study looked at the long-term effects ( maintenance ) of Humira in 854 patients over up to 56 weeks .
For psoriasis , Humira was compared with placebo over 16 weeks in 1,212 patients .
A second study compared Humira with methotrexate and with placebo in 271 patients over 16 weeks .
In all of the studies , the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms .
What benefit has Humira shown during the studies ?
Humira was more effective than placebo in all diseases studied .
In rheumatoid arthritis , the greatest reductions in symptoms were seen in the studies examining Humira as an add-on to methotrexate : around two thirds of the patients adding Humira had at least a 20 % reduction in symptoms after six months , compared with a quarter of those adding placebo .
Patients adding Humira also had less joint damage and experienced less reduction in physical function after a year .
In patients who had not taken methotrexate in the past , the combination of Humira and methotrexate was also more effective than methotrexate alone .
For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , around 40 % of the patients receiving Humira , either alone or in combination with methotrexate , had a flare-up of arthritis , compared with around 69 % of those receiving placebo .
However , fewer patients receiving Humira with methotrexate developed antibodies , so the results favoured the use of Humira with methotrexate over Humira used alone .
The fixed 40-mg dose , which is the only dose of Humira currently available , was considered to be suitable only for patients aged 13 years or above .
Humira also produced a greater improvement in symptoms than placebo in studies of psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , induction and maintenance phases of treatment for Crohn &quot; s disease , and psoriasis .
What is the risk associated with Humira ?
In studies of Humira , the most common side effect ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) was injection site reactions ( including pain , swelling , redness or itching ) .
Due to an increased risk of infection , patients taking Humira must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis during and for 2 / 3 up to five months after treatment .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Humira , see the Package Leaflet .
Humira should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients .
Humira must not be used in patients with tuberculosis , other severe infections , or moderate or severe heart failure ( an inability of the heart to pump enough blood around the body ) .
Why has Humira been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Humira &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , Crohn &quot; s disease and psoriasis . The Committee recommended that Humira be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Humira ?
The company that makes Humira will provide educational packs for doctors who will prescribe Humira .
These packs will include information on the safety of the medicine .
Other information about Humira :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Humira to Abbott Laboratories Ltd. on 8 September 2003 .
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 8 September 2008 .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
6 SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
The Belanette blister is glued in a carton which is subsequently folded to a wallet configuration .
The wallet with the inserted blister is assembled with a package leaflet ( PL ) and all components are wrapped together with clear , transparent cellophane wrapping to form the unit pack which prevents the loss of individual components .
The product is marketed in pack size of 3 x 21 film-coated tablets .
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF BELANETTE AND ASSOCIATED NAMES ( see Annex I )
The required basic information ( how to use the product , what to do in case of missed dose , etc . ) , which ensures the safe use of the product is present on the cardboard wallets and visible through the cellophane wrapping .
Once the cellophane wrapping is removed the safe use of the product is still ensured as the cardboard wallets contain the required information .
In addition it is not possible to separate blisters from cardboard wallets and therefore the users always have access to the required information .
Moreover cardboard wallets protect blisters against damage .
The risk resulting from the separation of a package leaflet from cardboard wallets is comparable with the risk resulting from separation of blisters from conventional external packaging ( cardboard box ) .
Although different observations in respect to readability of the Braille text through the cellophane wrapping have been made by blind users , it is assumed that before use of the product the cellophane wrapping will be removed and therefore blind person will be in a position to identify the product .
It has also been confirmed by blind persons that the Braille text on the cardboard is palpable and readable .
Since it is a prescription medicine , the name of the product always will be known to the blind user as during the visit the physicians inform patients about medicinal product they are prescribing , including the name of the product .
Therefore blind users will be able to double check the information written on the cardboard wallets ( Braille text ) with the information obtained from a physician ( during the visit ) .
Finally taking into account that the medicinal product is intended for long term use , the possible mistakes and misuse are further minimised .

BINOCRIT
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Binocrit ?
Binocrit is a solution for injection .
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international units ( IU ) of the active substance , epoetin alfa .
Binocrit is a &apos; biosimilar &quot; medicine .
This means that Binocrit is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also known as the &apos; reference medicine &quot; ) .
The reference medicine for Binocrit is Eprex / Erypo .
For more information on biosimilar medicines , see the question-and-answer document here .
What is Binocrit used for ?
Binocrit is used in the following situations : • to treat anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) that is causing symptoms in patients with &apos; chronic renal failure &quot; ( long-term , progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly ) or other kidney problems ; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions ; • to increase the amount of blood that can be taken in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery ( autologous blood transfusion ) ; • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery , such as hip surgery .
It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion , if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Binocrit used ?
Treatment with Binocrit must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for .
For patients with kidney problems and patients who are going to donate their own blood , Binocrit must be injected into a vein .
Patients receiving chemotherapy or about to undergo orthopaedic surgery must be injected under the skin . Binocrit can be injected under the skin by the patient or their carer if

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. they have been trained appropriately .
The dose , the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Binocrit is being used , and are adjusted according to the patient &quot; s response .
For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy , haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per decilitre in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body .
For these patients , the lowest dose that provides adequate control of symptoms should be used .
The iron levels of all patients should be checked before treatment to make sure that they are not too low , and iron supplements should be used throughout treatment .
For full details , see the Package Leaflet .
How does Binocrit work ?
A hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells from the bone marrow .
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys .
In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems , anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin , or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it has naturally .
In these cases , erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell counts .
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and help minimise the consequences of blood loss .
The active substance in Binocrit , epoetin alfa , is a copy of human erythropoietin and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production .
The epoetin alfa in Binocrit is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology &quot; : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce epoetin alfa .
How has Binocrit been studied ?
Binocrit was studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine , Eprex / Erypo , in experimental models and in humans .
Binocrit , injected into a vein , was compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems .
All of the patients had been taking Eprex / Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Binocrit or remained on Eprex / Erypo .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period , between weeks 25 and 29 .
The company also presented the results of a study comparing the effects of Binocrit injected under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy .
What benefit has Binocrit shown during the studies ?
Binocrit was as effective as Eprex / Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell counts .
In the study of patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems , patients switching to Binocrit maintained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo .
On average , the levels of the patients taking Binocrit increased by 0.147 g / dl from a starting value of 11.7 g / dl .
In comparison , those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g / dl from a starting value of 12.0 g / dl .
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Binocrit was also as effective as Eprex / Erypo when it was injected under the skin .
What is the risk associated with Binocrit ?
The most common side effect with Binocrit is an increase in blood pressure , which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion .
Binocrit can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptoms .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Binocrit , see the Package Leaflet .
Binocrit should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in the following groups : • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia ( reduced or stopped red blood cell production ) following treatment with any erythropoietin ; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled ; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack or stroke within the last month , who have angina pectoris ( a severe type of chest pain ) or who are at risk of deep venous thrombosis ( DVT : formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body , usually in the leg ) ; 2 / 3 • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots ; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular ( heart and blood vessel ) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke .
Binocrit is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
Why has Binocrit been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirements , Binocrit has been shown to have a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile to Eprex / Erypo .
Therefore , the CHMP &quot; s view was that , as for Eprex / Erypo , the benefit outweighs the identified risks . The Committee recommended that Binocrit be given marketing authorisation .

VECTIBIX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Vectibix ?
Vectibix is a concentrate that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance panitumumab .
What is Vectibix used for ?
Vectibix is used to treat metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum .
This is cancer of the lower intestine ( large bowel ) that has spread to other parts of the body .
Vectibix is used on its own in patients whose tumour cells have a protein on their surface called the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and which contain a non-mutated &apos; KRAS . &quot;
KRAS is a gene that , when mutated in tumour cells , stimulates tumour growth .
Vectibix is used after treatment with combinations of anticancer medicines that include a &apos; fluoropyrimidine &quot; ( such as 5-fluorouracil ) , oxaliplatin and irinotecan has stopped working .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Vectibix used ?
Treatment with Vectibix should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the use of anticancer therapy .
It should only be started once detection of non-mutated KRAS has been performed by an experienced laboratory using a reliable method .
The recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg per kilogram body weight given once every two weeks as an infusion .
The recommended infusion time is around 60 minutes , but larger doses may need 90 minutes .
How does Vectibix work ?
The active substance in Vectibix , panitumumab , is a monoclonal antibody .
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody ( a type of protein ) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure ( called an antigen ) that is found on certain cells in the body .
Panitumumab has been designed to bind to EGFR , which can be found on the surface of certain cells , including cells in some tumours .
As a result of this binding , these tumour cells can no longer receive the messages transmitted via EGFR that they need for growth , progression and spreading ( metastasis ) . Panitumumab does not seem to work in tumour cells that contain mutated KRAS .
This is because their growth is not controlled by signals transmitted via EGFR and they continue to grow even when the EGFR is blocked .

How has Vectibix been studied ?
The effects of Vectibix were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Vectibix has been studied in one main study involving a total of 463 patients with colon and rectum cancer whose disease had got worse during or after previous treatment that included a fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin and irinotecan .
The effects of Vectibix in addition to &apos; best supportive care &quot; were compared with those of best supportive care alone .
Best supportive care is any medicines or techniques to help patients , such as antibiotics , painkillers , transfusions and surgery , but not other anticancer medicines .
The main measure of effectiveness was the time taken before the disease started to get worse or the patient died .
The results of the study were analysed separately in 243 patients whose tumours contained KRAS that had not mutated and in 184 patients in whom the KRAS gene contained a mutation .
What benefit has Vectibix shown during the studies ?
In the patients with non-mutated KRAS in their tumours , Vectibix prolonged the time until the disease got worse or the patient died : this took an average of 12.3 weeks in the patients who took Vectibix in addition to best supportive care , compared with 7.3 weeks in those who received best supportive care alone .
In contrast , there was no effect of Vectibix in the patients with mutated KRAS in their tumours , with an average time of around 7.3 weeks until disease progression or death in both groups of patients .
What is the risk associated with Vectibix ?
Around 90 % of patients receiving Vectibix have side effects affecting the skin , although most of these are mild or moderate .
The most common side effects with Vectibix ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are rash , erythema ( redness of the skin ) , skin exfoliation ( skin flaking ) , pruritus ( itching ) , dry skin , skin fissures ( cracks in the skin ) , paronychia ( nail bed infection ) , diarrhoea , fatigue ( tiredness ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , vomiting , dyspnoea ( difficulty breathing ) and cough .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Vectibix , see the Package Leaflet .
Vectibix should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to panitumumab or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients with interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis ( lung diseases ) .
Why has Vectibix been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that Vectibix &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated ( wild-type ) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine- , oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens . The Committee recommended that Vectibix be given marketing authorisation .
Vectibix has been given &apos; Conditional Approval . &quot;
This means that there is more evidence to come about the medicine , in particular its safety and effectiveness in patients whose tumours contain non-mutated KRAS .
Every year , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary .
What information is still awaited for Vectibix ?
The company that makes Vectibix will supply the results of additional studies looking at the safety and effectiveness of the medicine in patients with colorectal cancer with and without mutated KRAS , as well as at the quality of life in patients receiving it .
These include studies looking at the use of Vectibix in combination with other medicines , both in patients whose disease has been treated before and in patients who have not received any previous treatment for their cancer , as well as a study to confirm the effectiveness of Vectibix , given on its own , in its approved use .

ZYPADHERA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .

What is Zypadhera ?
Zypadhera is a powder and solvent that are made up into a prolonged-release suspension for injection .
It contains the active substance olanzapine . &apos; Prolonged release &quot; means that the active substance is released slowly over a few weeks after being injected .
What is Zypadhera used for ?
Zypadhera is used to maintain the improvement in symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have already been stabilised on an initial course of olanzapine taken by mouth .
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that has a number of symptoms , including disorganised thinking and speech , hallucinations ( hearing or seeing things that are not there ) , suspiciousness and delusions ( false beliefs ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Zypadhera used ?
Zypadhera is given by deep injection into the buttock muscle by a doctor or nurse who has been trained in giving this type of injection .
In rare cases , patients receiving Zypadhera may experience symptoms of olanzapine overdose after injection if the medicine is accidentally injected into a vein .
Symptoms of overdose include sedation ( sleepiness ) and delirium ( confusion ) .
Because patients should be monitored by qualified staff for these symptoms for at least three hours after injection , they should receive Zypadhera at a centre with the appropriate facilities to deal with a potential overdose .
Patients who have symptoms of overdose should continue to be monitored until the symptoms have passed .
Zypadhera must not be injected into a vein or under the skin .
Zypadhera is given at doses of 150 , 210 or 300 mg every two weeks , or 300 or 405 mg every four weeks .
The dose depends on the dose of olanzapine that the patient was previously taking by mouth .
Patients should be monitored closely for signs of relapse ( a return of symptoms ) during the first one to two months of treatment , and the dose adjusted if necessary .
Zypadhera is not recommended for patients over 65 years of age .
However , patients aged between 65 and 75 years or patients with kidney or liver problems may use Zypadhera if an effective and well- tolerated dose of oral olanzapine has been found .

How does Zypadhera work ?
The active substance in Zypadhera , olanzapine , is an antipsychotic medicine .
It is known as an &apos; atypical &quot; antipsychotic because it is different from the older antipsychotic medicines that have been available since the 1950s .
Olanzapine attaches to several different receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
This disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by &apos; neurotransmitters , &quot; chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
It is thought that olanzapine &quot; s beneficial effect is due to it blocking receptors for the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytrypamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine .
Since these neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia , olanzapine helps to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing the symptoms of the disease .
Olanzapine has been authorised in the European Union ( EU ) since 1996 .
It is available as tablets , orodispersible tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) and rapidly acting injections in Zyprexa , Zyprexa Velotab and other medicines .
The olanzapine in Zypadhera is presented as a &apos; pamoate &quot; salt , which makes the olanzapine less soluble .
As a result , the active substance is released slowly for more than four weeks after injection of Zypadhera .
How has Zypadhera been studied ?
Because olanzapine has already been authorised in the EU as Zyprexa , the company used some of the data from Zyprexa to support the use of Zypadhera .
Zypadhera has been studied in two main studies involving adults with schizophrenia .
The first looked at the initial treatment of schizophrenia and the second looked at the maintenance of response to olanzapine treatment : • the study of initial treatment compared the effects of three doses of Zypadhera with those of placebo ( dummy injections ) in 404 patients .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms measured on a standard scale for schizophrenia after eight weeks ; • the study of maintenance treatment compared the effects of four doses of Zypadhera with those of olanzapine taken by mouth in 1,065 patients .
Three of the doses of Zypadhera were &apos; high &quot; ( 300 mg and 150 mg every two weeks , and 405 mg every four weeks ) and one was &apos; low &quot; ( 45 mg every four weeks ) .
All of the patients in this study had been stabilised with other treatments for schizophrenia and had been taking olanzapine by mouth for at least six weeks before the study began .
The main measures of effectiveness were the time taken for symptoms to get worse and the number of patients whose symptoms got worse over 24 weeks .
What benefit has Zypadhera shown during the studies ?
In the study of the initial treatment of schizophrenia , Zypadhera was more effective than placebo .
Symptom scores were around 100 points at the start of the study , but had fallen by around 25 points in the patients receiving Zypadhera after eight weeks , compared with around 9 points in the patients receiving placebo .
The effectiveness of Zypadhera was greater than placebo from the second week of treatment onwards .
In the study looking at the maintenance of response to olanzapine treatment , Zypadhera was as effective as olanzapine taken by mouth :
10 % of the patients receiving Zypadhera every two weeks had a worsening of symptoms , compared with 7 % of those taking olanzapine by mouth .
The &apos; high &quot; doses of Zypadhera were more effective at preventing a worsening of symptoms than the &apos; low &quot; dose .
What is the risk associated with Zypadhera ?
The most common side effects with Zypadhera ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are weight gain , somnolence ( sleepiness ) and raised levels of prolactin ( a hormone ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Zypadhera , see the Package Leaflet .
Zypadhera should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma ( raised pressure inside the eye ) .
Why has Zypadhera been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Zypadhera is effective both in the initial treatment of schizophrenia and in maintaining a response to treatment in schizophrenia .
However , it noted that prolonged-release injections are not suitable for use as initial treatment , because the medicine takes at least a week to reduce symptoms and patients may need rapid control of symptoms .
In addition , it is not possible to stop treatment after giving a prolonged-release 2 / 3 injection , which would not be suitable for patients experiencing side effects .
Therefore , the Committee decided that Zypadhera &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for maintenance treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine . The Committee recommended that Zypadhera be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Zypadhera ?
The company that makes Zypadhera will provide an educational programme for doctors , nurses and pharmacists and a card for patients in all Member States , reminding them of how to use the medicine safely .
These will include information on what to do before and after each injection , the differences between Zypadhera and other injectable medicines containing olanzapine , and the recommendations on how patients should be monitored .
Other information about Zypadhera :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Zypadhera to Eli Lilly Nederland BV on 19 November 2008 .

TREVACLYN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Trevaclyn ?
Trevaclyn is a medicine containing two active substances : nicotinic acid ( also known as niacin or vitamin B3 ) and laropiprant .
It is available as modified-release tablets . &apos; Modified-release &quot; means that the two active substances are released at different rates from the tablet over a few hours .
What is Trevaclyn used for ?
Trevaclyn is used in addition to diet and exercise in patients with dyslipidaemia ( abnormally high levels of fat in the blood ) , particularly &apos; combined mixed dyslipidaemia &quot; and &apos; primary hypercholesterolaemia . &quot;
Patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia have high blood levels of &apos; bad &quot; LDL cholesterol and triglycerides ( a type of fat ) , and low levels of &apos; good &quot; HDL cholesterol .
Primary hypercholesterolaemia is when the levels of cholesterol in the blood are high .
Primary means that the hypercholesterolaemia does not have any identifiable cause .
Trevaclyn is normally given together with a statin ( the standard medicine used to reduce cholesterol ) when the effectiveness of a statin taken alone is inadequate .
Trevaclyn is used on its own only in patients who cannot take statins .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Trevaclyn used ?
The starting dose of Trevaclyn is one tablet once a day for four weeks , after which the dose is increased to two tablets once a day .
It is taken by mouth , with food , in the evening or before going to bed .
The tablets must be swallowed whole , and should not be split , broken , crushed or chewed .
Trevaclyn is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of a lack of information on its safety and effectiveness in this group .
It should be used with caution in patients who have problems with their kidneys and should not be used in patients with liver problems . How does Trevaclyn work ? The two active substances in Trevaclyn , nicotinic acid and laropiprant , have different modes of action .
Nicotinic acid is a naturally occurring substance that is used in low doses as a vitamin . In higher doses , it reduces the levels of fat in the blood via a mechanism that is not fully understood .

Flushing due to nicotinic acid is thought to occur because of the release of a substance called &apos; prostaglandin D2 &quot; ( PGD2 ) from cells in the skin , which dilates ( widens ) the blood vessels in the skin .
Laropiprant blocks the receptors to which PGD2 normally attaches .
When the receptors are blocked , PGD2 cannot dilate the vessels in the skin , reducing the frequency and intensity of flushing .
In Trevaclyn tablets , laropiprant is in one of the layers , and the other layer contains nicotinic acid .
When the patient takes the tablet , laropiprant is released first into the bloodstream and blocks the PGD2 receptors .
The nicotinic acid is released more slowly from the other layer and has its effect as a fat-modifying agent .
How has Trevaclyn been studied ?
The effects of Trevaclyn were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Trevaclyn was studied in four main studies in patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia .
Two studies looked at the effectiveness of Trevaclyn in modifying blood fat levels .
The first study compared the effectiveness of Trevaclyn with that of nicotinic acid alone or placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol in a total of 1,613 patients .
This study also looked at the symptoms of flushing using a specially designed questionnaire .
The second study compared the combination of Trevaclyn and simvastatin ( a statin ) with Trevaclyn alone or simvastatin alone in 1,398 patients .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the blood levels of LDL cholesterol after 12 weeks .
The third and fourth studies looked at the effectiveness of laropiprant in reducing the flushing caused by nicotinic acid .
They included a total of 2,349 patients who were taking either Trevaclyn or nicotinic acid .
Flushing was measured using the flushing symptom questionnaire .
What benefit has Trevaclyn shown during the studies ?
Trevaclyn was effective in reducing the blood levels of LDL cholesterol .
In the first study , LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 19 % in patients taking Trevaclyn , compared with 1 % in those taking placebo .
The second study showed that the LDL cholesterol levels were further reduced when Trevaclyn was taken with simvastatin ( 48 % reduction ) , compared with Trevaclyn alone ( 17 % reduction ) or simvastatin alone ( 37 % reduction ) .
Adding laropiprant to nicotinic acid reduced the symptoms of flushing caused by nicotinic acid .
In the first and third studies , fewer patients taking Trevaclyn reported moderate , severe or extreme flushing than patients taking nicotinic acid alone .
In the fourth study , flushing was seen on fewer days in patients taking Trevaclyn than in those taking nicotinic acid alone .
What is the risk associated with Trevaclyn ?
The most common side effect with Trevaclyn ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is flushing .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Trevaclyn , see the Package Leaflet .
Trevaclyn should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to nicotinic acid , laropiprant or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients who have problems with their liver , an active stomach ulcer or bleeding from an artery .
Why has Trevaclyn been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Trevaclyn &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of dyslipidaemia , particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia . The Committee recommended that Trevaclyn be given marketing authorisation .

What is Valdoxan ?
Valdoxan is a medicine that contains the active substance agomelatine .
It is available as orange- yellow , oblong tablets ( 25 mg ) .
What is Valdoxan used for ?
Valdoxan is used to treat major depression in adults .
Major depression is a condition in which patients have mood disturbances that interfere with their everyday life .
Symptoms often include deep sadness , feelings of worthlessness , loss of interest in favourite activities , sleep disturbances , a feeling of being slowed down , feelings of anxiety and changes in weight .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Valdoxan used ?
The recommended dose of Valdoxan is one tablet once a day , taken at bedtime with or without food .
If there is no improvement in symptoms after two weeks , the doctor may increase the dose to two tablets taken together at bedtime .
Patients with depression should be treated for at least six months to make sure that they are free of symptoms .
The patient &quot; s liver should be checked with blood tests when treatment starts , and then after around six , 12 and 24 weeks of treatment The liver should also be checked if the patient develops symptoms that could indicate liver problems .
Treatment should be interrupted in patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels in the blood .
Blood tests should then be repeated until the liver enzymes have returned to normal levels .
Because a benefit of Valdoxan has not been shown clearly in patients aged over 65 years , it should be used with caution in this age group .
It should also be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe kidney problems .
It must not be used in patients who have liver problems .
How does Valdoxan work ? The active substance in Valdoxan , agomelatine , is an antidepressant .

This is believed to help relieve the symptoms of depression .
Valdoxan might also help to normalise the patient &quot; s sleep patterns .
How has Valdoxan been studied ?
The effects of Valdoxan were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Valdoxan has been compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in five main short-term studies involving a total of 1,893 adults with major depression .
Three of these studies included some patients treated with other antidepressants , either fluoxetine or paroxetine , as an &apos; active comparator . &quot;
The active comparator groups were included to check that the study was able to measure the effectiveness of medicines in treating depression .
The main measure of effectiveness in these five studies was the change in symptoms after six weeks , as measured on a standard scale for depression called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) .
The company also presented the results of a further study comparing Valdoxan with sertraline ( another antidepressant ) .
Two other main studies compared the ability of Valdoxan and placebo to prevent symptoms returning in 706 patients whose depression had already been controlled with Valdoxan .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose symptoms returned during 24 to 26 weeks of treatment .
What benefit has Valdoxan shown during the studies ?
In the short-term studies , Valdoxan was seen to be more effective than placebo in the two studies where no active comparator was used .
In the other three studies , which did include an active comparator , there were no differences in scores between the patients taking Valdoxan and those taking placebo .
However , no effect of fluoxetine or paroxetine was seen in two of these studies , making the results difficult to interpret .
The additional study showed that agomelatine was more effective than sertraline , with a difference in HAM-D scores of 1.68 after six weeks .
In the first of the long-term studies , there was no difference between Valdoxan and placebo in preventing symptoms returning during 26 weeks of treatment .
However , the second study showed that symptoms returned in 21 % of the patients taking Valdoxan over 24 weeks ( 34 out of 165 ) , compared with 41 % of the patients taking placebo ( 72 out of 174 ) .
What is the risk associated with Valdoxan ?
The most common side effects with Valdoxan ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are headache , dizziness , somnolence ( sleepiness ) , insomnia ( difficulty sleeping ) , migraine , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , constipation , upper abdominal pain ( tummy ache ) , hyperhidrosis ( excessive sweating ) , back pain , fatigue ( tiredness ) , increases in liver enzymes and anxiety .
Most side effects were mild or moderate in intensity and happened within the first two weeks of treatment .
Some of these side effects may be linked to the patient &quot; s depression rather than Valdoxan itself .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Valdoxan , see the Package Leaflet .
Valdoxan should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in patients who have problems with their liver , such as cirrhosis ( scarring of the liver ) or active liver disease .
It must also not be used in patients who are taking medicines that slow down the breakdown of Valdoxan in the body , such as fluvoxamine ( another antidepressant ) and ciprofloxacin ( an antibiotic ) .
Valdoxan should not be used in elderly patients with dementia .
Why has Valdoxan been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Valdoxan &quot; s benefits in terms of treating depression might be lower than seen with other antidepressants .
However , since the medicine has a new mode of action , few side effects and a different safety profile to existing antidepressants , the Committee concluded that Valdoxan could be a valuable treatment for some patients as long as their liver function is tested frequently .
Therefore , the CHMP decided that Valdoxan &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults . The Committee recommended that Valdoxan be given marketing authorisation .
2 / 3 Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Valdoxan ?
The company that makes Valdoxan will supply educational material for prescribers of Valdoxan when it is launched .
This material will explain the safety of the medicine , particularly its possible effects on the liver and its interactions with other medicines .

EXTAVIA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Extavia ?
Extavia is a powder and solvent that are made up into a solution for injection .
It contains 250 micrograms ( 8 million international units - MIU ) per millilitre of the active substance interferon beta-1b .
This medicine is the same as Betaferon , which is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) .
The company that makes Betaferon has agreed that its scientific data can be used for Extavia .
What is Extavia used for ?
Extavia is used to treat adult patients who have multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
MS is a disease of the nerves , in which inflammation destroys the protective sheath around the nerves .
This is called &apos; demyelination . &quot;
It is used in patients : • who have experienced the signs of MS ( &apos; demyelination event &quot; ) for the first time , and these are severe enough to justify treatment with injected corticosteroids ( anti-inflammatory medicines ) .
It is used when the patient is considered to be at high risk of developing MS .
Before using it , doctors need to exclude other causes for the symptoms . • who have MS of the type known as &apos; relapsing-remitting , &quot; when the patient has attacks ( relapses ) within periods with no symptoms ( remissions ) , and with at least two relapses within the last two years . • who have secondary progressive MS ( the type of MS that comes after relapsing-remitting MS ) , when their disease is active .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Extavia used ?
Extavia treatment should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of MS .
The treatment should start with 62.5 micrograms ( a quarter of the dose ) every other day , increasing progressively over 19 days to reach the recommended dose of 250 micrograms ( 8 MIU ) given every other day .
Extavia is given by an injection under the skin .
The patients can inject Extavia themselves , provided that they have been trained .

How does Extavia work ?
The active substance in Extavia , interferon beta-1b , belongs to the group &apos; interferons . &quot;
Interferons are natural substances produced by the body to help it fight against attacks such as infections caused by viruses .
The exact way that Extavia works in MS is not yet known but beta-interferon seems to calm down the immune system ( the body &quot; s natural defences ) and prevents the relapses of MS .
Interferon beta-1b is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology . &quot;
The interferon beta-1b is made by a bacterium that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce it .
The replacement interferon beta-1b acts in the same way as naturally produced interferon beta .
How has Extavia been studied ?
Extavia was studied over a two year period in 338 patients with relapsing remitting MS and able to walk unaided , where its effectiveness was compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of relapses .
Extavia has also been studied in 1,657 patients in two studies of secondary progressive MS patients who were able to walk , where it was compared with placebo .
The main measure of effectiveness was the delay to progression of disability .
The study of Extavia in patients with a single demyelinating event involved 487 patients , who received either Extavia or placebo for two years .
The study measured the time it took for a patient to develop clinically defined MS .
What benefit has Extavia shown during the studies ?
In patients with relapsing remitting MS , Extavia was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of annual relapses : patients receiving the medicine had on average 0.84 relapses a year , when patients on placebo had 1.27 relapses .
One of the two studies in patients with secondary progressive MS showed a significant delay in the time to disability progression ( 31 % risk reduction due to Extavia ) and in the time to becoming wheelchair bound ( 39 % ) .
In the second trial , no delay in the time to disability progression was seen .
In both trials , Extavia showed a reduction in the number ( 30 % ) of clinical relapses .
In the study of patients with a single demyelinating event , Extavia was shown to reduce the risk of developing clinically defined MS :
28 % of the patients who received Extavia developed MS , against 45 % of those who received placebo .
What is the risk associated with Extavia ?
Very common side effects with Extavia ( seen more than 1 patients in 10 ) are flu-like symptoms , fever , chills and injection site reactions ( inflammation and pain at the site of injection ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Extavia , see the Package Leaflet .
Extavia should not be used in people who have a history of hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to natural or recombinant interferon beta , human albumin or any of the other ingredients .
Extavia treatment should not be started during pregnancy .
If a woman becomes pregnant while taking the medicine , she should consult her doctor .
Extavia should not be used in patients who are currently suffering from severe depression and / or have thoughts of suicide .
Extavia should not be used in patients who have decompensated liver disease ( when the liver does not function normally ) .
Why has Extavia been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Extavia &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event , if it is severe enough to justify treatment with intravenous corticosteroids , patients with relapsing-remitting MS and patients with secondary progressive MS with active disease .
They recommended that Extavia be given marketing authorisation .

Questions and answers on the referral for Tritazide tablets containing ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 2.5 / 12.5 mg , 5 / 12.5 mg , 5 / 25 mg
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a review of Tritazide .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that there is a need to harmonise the prescribing information for Tritazide in the European Union and the European Economic Area ( EEA ) .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 30 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Tritazide ?
Tritazide contains two active substances , ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide .
Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor .
ACE inhibitors lower the production of angiotensin II , a powerful vasoconstrictor ( a substance that narrows blood vessels ) .
When the production of angiotensin II is lowered , the blood vessels relax and widen .
This allows the heart to pump blood more easily , and the blood flow increases due to more blood being pumped into and through larger passageways .
Hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) is a diuretic .
It works by increasing urine output , reducing the amount of fluid in the blood and lowering the blood pressure .
Tritazide is used in the treatment of hypertension and it is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with ramipril alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone .
Tritazide has been authorised in the EU since 1993 , first in Germany and then in the following countries :
Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia , Slovenia and Sweden .
Tritazide can also be available in the EU and the EEA under other trade names :
Tritace Plus , Triatec Plus , Triatec Comp , Tritace Comp , Tritace Comb , Triatec Composto , Triatec Composto Forte , Cardace Comp , Cardace Plus , Cotriatec , Delix Plus , Ramilich Comp , Tritace HCT , Triatec HCT , Ramipril e Idrocloritiazide , Ramicor D , and Triatec Comp Mite , Hypren Plus , Hypren Plus Forte , Vesdil Plus , Ramipril HCT Zentiva , Unipril Diur , Idroquark ..
The company that markets Tritazide is Sanofi-aventis .
Why was Tritazide reviewed ?
Tritazide is authorised in the European Union ( EU ) via national procedures .
This has led to divergences across member states on the way the medicine can be used , as seen in the differences observed in the Summaries of Product Characteristics ( SPCs ) , labelling and package leaflets in the countries where the product is marketed .
Tritazide has been identified as needing harmonisation by the Co-ordination Group on the Mutual and Decentralised Procedures - Human ( CMD ( h ) ) .

On 18 January 2008 , the European Commission referred the matter to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) in order to harmonise the marketing authorisations for Tritazide in the EU and the EEA .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
The CHMP , in the light of the data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee , was of the opinion that the SPCs , labelling and package leaflets should be harmonised across the EU .
The areas harmonised include :
4.1 Therapeutic Indications
The CHMP noted inconsistencies in the wording of the indication across countries , with terms including &apos; essential hypertension , &quot; &apos; arterial hypertension &quot; and &apos; arterial essential hypertension &quot; being used .
The CHMP highlighted that fact that the indication should be hypertension , and as add-on therapy when each monotherapy has failed .
The combination ramipril 2.5 mg / HCTZ 12.5 mg led to greater reduction in blood pressure than the treatment with individual components and the combination of 5 mg / 25 mg produced a better therapeutic effect than doubling the ramipril dose to 10 mg .
Considering that no major concern can be established concerning the safety , efficacy and clinical adverse event of the ramipril / HCTZ combination in non responders to HCTZ and ramipril alone , the CHMP adopted the following two harmonised wordings for indications : • Treatment of hypertension • This fixed dose combination is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with ramipril alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The CHMP discussed the areas where there was a divergence identified in the dose recommendations .
In most cases the initial recommended dose was the same , but there were differences with respect to subsequent titration ( both in terms of frequency of increase and maximum daily dose ) .
The CHMP also noted that there were limited trial data regarding titration steps with the combination .
The CHMP adopted the harmonised wording :
The dose should be individualised according to the patient profile ( see section 4.4 ) and blood pressure control .
The administration of the fixed combination of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide is usually recommended after dosage titration with one of the individual components .
Tritazide and associated names should be started at the lowest available dosage .
If necessary , the dose can be progressively increased to achieve target blood pressure ; the maximum permitted doses are 10 mg of ramipril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily .
4.3 Contra-indications
The majority of the contraindications are related to use of ramipril as a component of Tritazide .
They are extended with the contraindications of HCTZ .
The CHMP noted that some of the contraindications in local SPCs ( such as acute hypertension or primary aldosteronism ) were in fact non-indications .
The CHMP adopted the following harmonised wording : • Hypersensitivity to the active substance , to any of the excipients or any other ACE ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ) inhibitors ( see section 6.1 ) • History of angioedema ( hereditary , idiopathic or due to previous angioedema wit ACE inhibitors or AIIRAs ( Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists ) ) • Extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces ( see section 4.5 ) • Significant bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a single functioning kidney • 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy ( see section 4.4 and 4.6 ) • Lactation ( see section 4.6 ) Page 2 / 3 • Severe impairment of renal function with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml / min in undialysed patients • Clinically relevant electrolyte disturbances which may worsen following treatment with TRITAZIDE ( see section 4.4 ) • Severe impairment of liver function , hepatic encephalopathy
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
The CHMP included under this session the warning about primary hyperaldosteronism , therefore adopted the following harmonised wording :
The combination ramipril + hydrochlorothiazide does not represent a treatment of choice for primary hyperaldosteronism .
If ramipril + hydrochlorothiazide is used in a patient with primary hyperaldosteronism , then careful monitoring of plasma potassium level is required .
The CHMP included also new warnings for : pregnancy , surgery , electrolyte disturbances , and cough .
4.5 Interactions
The CHMP endorsed the current list of products which interact or may interact with Tritazide , including additional text reinforcing lithium toxicity .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation The CHMP recommended a contra indication only for the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
This is in line with the recommendation of the CHMP &quot; s Pharmacovigilance Working Party on use of ACE inhibitors in pregnancy .
The European Commission issued a decision on 6 March 2009 .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
RECONCILE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report . Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
If you need more information about your animal &quot; s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Reconcile ?
Reconcile is a veterinary medicine containing the active substance fluoxetine .
It is available as chewable tablets containing 8 mg , 16 mg , 32 mg or 64 mg fluoxetine .
What is Reconcile used for ?
Reconcile is used , in combination with behavioural modification techniques , to assist in the treatment of dogs that have behavioural problems ( separation anxiety ) caused by separation from their owners , their normal home , or other dogs .
These behavioural problems might be expressed by excessive barking or howling , inappropriate defecation or urination in the house , or destruction of their surroundings .
Reconcile should not be used on its own but only in dogs that are also undergoing behavioural therapy .
Reconcile tablets are given once a day .
The strength of tablet to be given is based on the dog &quot; s weight , so that the dog is given between 1 to 2 mg per kg of the dog &quot; s bodyweight per day .
The tablets are chewable and may be given either with or without food .
How does Reconcile work ?
The active substance in Reconcile , fluoxetine , is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) .
It works by preventing the neurotransmitter serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord .
Neurotransmitters such as serotonin are chemicals that transfer chemical signals from one nerve cell to another .
Low levels of serotonin in the central nervous system may be associated with depression , anxiety or aggression .
By blocking the re-uptake of serotonin into nerve cells , fluoxetine allows the levels of serotonin to remain higher .
This can improve the clinical signs ( behavioural problems ) of separation-related disorders in dogs .
In order to treat a dog with separation anxiety , the animal should not only receive medicines but also behavioural modification therapy .
Behavioural modification therapy is the most important part of therapy ; however , the use of the medicine allows for a more speedy recovery of the animal patient .
Reconcile has been investigated in four different studies in pet dogs for up to 8 weeks . The effective dose of Reconcile was established in one study . Another study investigated the efficacy of Reconcile in dogs which also received behavioural modification therapy , whilst a 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

In both of those studies the effectiveness of Reconcile was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) for up to 8 weeks .
The last study was conducted under &quot; field conditions &quot; in a large number of dogs that were treated for separation anxiety in various veterinary practices , or clinics , in two European countries .
All dogs received behavioural therapy and were treated either with Reconcile or with clomipramine ( another medicine that can be used to treat dogs with separation-related disorders ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in each of the nine different behaviours recognised as characteristic indicators of separation anxiety in dogs .
In all the studies Reconcile was given once a day , either with or without food .
What benefit has Reconcile shown during the studies ?
The oral administration of Reconcile tablets , as 1 to 2 mg / kg of fluoxetine once a day , is effective for the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs when used in conjunction with behavioural modification therapy .
The efficacy of Reconcile was higher when compared to placebo when behavioural modification therapy was also given to the dogs .
The efficacy was lower when no behavioural modification therapy was given .
When given in combination with behavioural modification therapy , approximately 42 % of dogs given Reconcile improved within one week , compared to only 17 % of the dogs given placebo ( plus the behavioural modification therapy ) .
The fluoxetine-treated group continued to have a higher incidence of improvement over the course of the treatment period and by the end of the 8 weeks , approximately 72 % of the fluoxetine- treated dogs had shown improved behaviour ( a global severity score of 50 % ) .
The field study showed that Reconcile was as effective as clomipramine .
In conjunction with behavioural modification therapy , Reconcile showed significant improvements in treating dogs for barking and inappropriate defecation or urination .
After 8 weeks , two separation anxiety behaviours were significantly improved in the fluoxetine group ( inappropriate defecation and destructive behaviour ) .
Six weeks after the end of treatment , five out of the nine separation anxiety behaviours were still improved in about a third of the treated dogs .
The rate of relapse at the end of the post-treatment phase was slightly higher in the fluoxetine group ( 28 % ) than in the clomipramine group ( 23 % ) .
What is the risk associated with Reconcile ?
The most common side effects with Reconcile are anorexia ( loss of appetite ) and lethargy ( unresponsiveness ) .
Urinary tract disorders ( such as bladder infections , irregular urination and discomfort in passing urine ) and central nervous system signs ( such as incoordination and disorientation ) were also observed .
Less commonly , weight loss / loss of condition , dilation of the pupils of the eye and , rarely , seizures were also observed .
To minimize the risk of adverse reactions , the recommended dose of Reconcile should not be exceeded .
For a full list of all side-effects reported with Reconcile , see the Package Leaflet .
Reconcile tablets should not be used in dogs weighing less than 4 kg , or in dogs with epilepsy or with a history of seizures .
Reconcile should also not be used in dogs that may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to fluoxetine or other SSRIs .
Since Reconcile has not been tested in pregnant or lactating bitches , its use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation .
Reconcile tablets should not be used at the same time as many other medicines , especially medicines that can affect the central nervous system .
See the Package Leaflet for full information .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
Page 2 / 3 This veterinary medicine has been developed especially for dogs and is not for use in humans .
If a person accidentally takes the medicine , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to a doctor .
Why has Reconcile been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Reconcile exceed the risks when used in combination with behavioural modification techniques as an aid in the treatment of dogs with behavioural problems caused by separation , and recommended that Reconcile be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
Other information about Reconcile :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Reconcile to Eli Lilly and Company Ltd on 08.07.2008 .

Introduction and background
On 27 November 2007 , Ireland presented to the EMEA a referral under Article 35 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , concerning all oral soluble powders containing sodium salicylate which are indicated for calves and pigs .
Ireland considered that there was a potentially serious risk to animal health by providing for the authorisation of a potentially ineffective medicine for mass use by farmers , especially when there are several authorised NSAIDs available for individual animal use .
Ireland believed that the use of such a medicine for mass medication could mask the clinical signs of a developing infectious disease which could spread to other animals and thereby pose both an animal health and public health risk .
The referral procedure started on 11 December 2007 and after adoption of a list of questions , the clock was stopped on 15 January 2008 .
Further to the submission of responses to questions , the clock was re-started on 14 March 2008 .
The aim of the assessment was to establish whether marketing authorisations and applications included in the referral procedure should be granted , maintained , suspended , varied or revoked with view to the grounds for referral .
As the procedure concerns a range of products , the assessment has been limited to specific parts of the authorisations in accordance with Article 35 ( 2 ) of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended .
The Marketing Authorisation Holders and Applicant submitted written responses and the clock was re- started on 14 March 2008 .
The clock was stopped again on 14 May 2008 and restarted on 6 June when responses to the outstanding issues where received .
Oral explanations were provided on 15 July 2008 and the CVMP Opinion was adopted on 16 July 2008 .

Discussion
2.1 Questions put to the Marketing Authorisation Holder
The MAHs are requested to provide from the dossier submitted for each country of the EEA where the products are authorised : a ) the Part I Summary of the dossier including SPCs , expert reports and the full composition of the products ; b ) if applicable , Part IV of the application dossier ; c ) an Assessment of the Periodic Safety Update Reports ( PSURs ) in relation to target animal safety and possible lack of efficacy .
Pivotal documents , including the SPC , should be presented in English .
It is known that sodium salicylate when administered by the intravenous route to calves prior to castration failed to attenuate the cortisol response1 . Given this outcome together with published data on the pharmacokinetics of sodium salicylate in calves and significant variation in individual pig concentrations post treatment2 , the MAHs should justify that therapeutic concentrations are established and maintained following oral use of the drug through water medication and submit all available data that could substantiate the posology and dosage regimen of sodium salicylate when given orally to calves and pigs , together with a thorough discussion of the these data .

The MAHs should discuss the benefit / risk balance of the product , with special regard to : • the merits of using sodium salicylate as an oral medication for mass administration in cattle and pigs when individual treatment with parenteral NSAIDs may offer more precise therapy ; • the use for analgesic and antipyretic effects under field condition , bearing in mind that the use in young animals which are suffering disease stress may lead to a potentiation of the undesirable effects of salicylate toxicity .
2.2 Documentation provided
Asprimax 850 mg / g
Chevita Ges m. b . H. submitted all requested parts of the dossier ( Part I and Part IV ) as well as a dose determination study , which was not included in Part IV of the application dossier .
NA-Salicylaat , 100 % , powder for solution for oral administration and NA-Salicylaat , 80 % WSP
Dopharma submitted all requested parts of the dossier ( Part I , Part IV and PSURs ) .
Dopharma also described the history of the product since 1987 , the year of its first authorisation in the Netherlands .
Solacyl 100 % , powder for oral solution for calves and pigs
Eurovet referred to the originator product from Dopharma , Na-salicylaat 100 % , REG NL 8913 .
As a generic product only part I and not part IV of the dossier was submitted .
No PSURs were submitted as the product is not yet marketed .
Solacyl was the subject of an Article 33 Referral , further to the submission of a Decentralised Application .
The CVMP concluded that Solacyl 100 % powder for oral solution was essentially similar to the reference product , Natrium salicylaat 100 % .
Consequently , the same conclusions on efficacy and safety apply to both products .
It was recommended that Solacyl 100 % powder for oral solution for calves and pigs should follow the outcome of the Community Referral according to Article 35 ( 2 ) for sodium salicylate-containing oral soluble powders .
The Commission Decision on the Article 33 referral was adopted on 17 April 2008 .
3 .
Conclusion
Having considered the grounds for referral and the responses provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder and Applicant the CVMP concludes that :
• Therapeutic concentrations are established and maintained following oral use of sodium salicylate in calves and pigs . The dosage required for calves is however 40 mg / kg bodyweight .
• The efficacy of sodium salicylate as supportive treatment when given to calves and pigs was demonstrated in respiratory infections and the usefulness of this compound was clear for the treatment of inflammation in combination with concurrent antibiotic therapy .
• The benefit / risk balance of the product was shown to be positive , however in young animals , the summary of Product Characteristics should state that the product is not to be used in neonates or very young calves of less than 2 weeks of age nor in piglets of less than 4 weeks of age
5 / 9 The following indications have been justified :
4.2 Indications for use , specifying the target species
Pigs : to promote recovery of respiration and to reduce coughing in respiratory tract infections with concurrent antibiotic therapy .
NA-Salicylaat , 100 % , powder for solution for oral administration
Calves : supportive treatment of pyrexia in acute respiratory disease , in combination with appropriate ( e. g. anti-infective ) therapy if necessary .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
3 / 6
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING VERALIPRIDE ( see Annex I )
Veralipride is a benzamide neuroleptic medicine indicated in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
It was first authorised in 1979 and is currently authorised in the EU in Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg and Portugal under the names Agreal and Agradil .
Until June 2005 , veralipride was authorised in Spain .
Following reports of serious side effects affecting the nervous system , the Spanish National Competent Authority concluded that its benefits did not outweigh its potential risks .
Spain therefore withdrew veralipride &quot; s marketing authorisation on 27 June 2005 .
Regulatory actions were also taken in some other EU Member States where the product is authorised and veralipride &quot; s product information was restricted with the aim to reduce the risk of patients developing side effects .
Consequently , the European Commission triggered a referral procedure on 7 September 2006 and requested the CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for products containing veralipride should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn across the European Union following the assessment of these safety risks their impact on the benefit / risk assessment of veralipride .
Efficacy In this review , the CHMP assessed all of the available information on the safety and efficacy of veralipride .
This included mainly 11 studies involving around 600 women , in which veralipride was compared with placebo , and two studies in around 100 women where it was compared with conjugated oestrogens . The CHMP also looked at other small studies .
Based on the submitted data , there appears to be an effect for veralipride in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
The benefit could be qualified as limited , however the effect size cannot be accurately quantified due to methodological deficiencies of available studies ( e. g. in most cases baseline values were not stated , precluding an adequate assessment of the improvement observed ; neither the statistical nor the clinical significance of this effect size could be precisely quantified , as the statistical plan was not clear or was absent ; the presentation of the results was poor ) . In addition , the duration of the trials was too short to allow for proper assessment of maintenance of efficacy .
Few data are available beyond 3 months , mostly in non comparative studies .
The CHMP concluded that the data submitted showed only limited effect of veralipride in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
In addition , the effect size cannot be accurately quantified due to methodological shortcomings and the duration of the trials was too short to allow for proper assessment of maintenance of efficacy .
Safety The 27-year post-marketing period offers a long period of safety profile surveillance .
Neurological adverse events referred to extrapyramidal symptoms and particularly tardive dyskinesias have been reported with veralipride and represent a real concern due to their potential seriousness and irreversibility . It has to be noted that tardive dyskinesias are not predictable and can develop even after the treatment has been discontinued .
Psychiatric adverse events mainly referred to depressive and anxiety states have also been reported with veralipride . Most of them occurred beyond 3 months of treatment .
It should be noted that in the evaluation of the causality assessment of veralipride in the psychiatric events , the role of veralipride is not always clear .
In order to avoid psychiatric AE , extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia , the MAH proposed a maximally allowed duration of 3 months veralipride treatment . However , cases of tardive
4 / 6
dyskinesia have also been reported within the first 3 months of treatment .
The proposal of close monitoring including neurological examination after each 20 day treatment cycle might reduce these risks , but is a measure of considerable burden to both patient and doctor .
As for the other adverse events related with the blockage of the dopamine receptor , especially hyperprolactinemia is a concern .
Veralipride treatment is contra-indicated in patients with prolactin- dependent tumours such as pituitary gland prolactinoma and breast cancer .
But the effect of hyperprolactinemia in women with history of breast cancer is not elucidated .
The proposed intermittent treatment of 20 days , followed by a 10 day period of non-treatment , may temper this effect on the prolactin level , but it is unknown whether this measure has any effect on the adverse event pattern .
Lastly , QT-prolongation is a class-effect of dopamine-antagonists .
The absence of cases of suggestive QT-prolongation in the database is not sufficient to conclude that this effect does not occur with veralipride . No studies were performed to evaluate whether veralipride has an effect on QT .
Benefit / risk In view of the available clinical data the CHMP concluded that the risks associated with the use of veralipride in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause , mainly the neurological reactions ( dyskinesia , extrapyramidal disorder , Parkinson syndrome ) and psychiatric reactions ( depression , anxiety , withdrawal syndrome ) outweigh the limited benefits .
Cases of not predictable and potentially irreversible tardive dyskinesia , as well as early extrapyramidal symptoms , depression , anxiety and withdrawal reactions have been reported with veralipride treatment ; these risks together with the risk of hyperprolactinemia , and the class effect risk on QT- prolongation are considered a concern .
The CHMP took note of the MAH &quot; s proposals , some of which had already been introduced in some countries , in an effort to limit these risks like :
-Restriction of the treatment duration to 3 months in combination with monthly examination in an effort to limit the psychiatric and neurological adverse events .
However , tardive dyskinesia may still occur within the first 3 months of treatment .
-Introduction of the contraindications in patients with Parkinson &quot; s disease , or in combination with other neuroleptics and dopaminergic agonists .
-Introduction of warnings regarding class effects of neuroleptic medicines ( neuroleptic malignant syndrome , QT prolongation , tardive dyskinesia ) and withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety and depressive syndrome .
-Recommendations of medical breast monitoring and intermittent schedule ( 20 days followed by a 10- day period of non-treatment ) to reduce the risk of hyperprolactinemia , aimed to improve the breast safety ( however , it is unknown whether this measure has any effect on the observed adverse event pattern related to hyperprolactinemia like breast enlargement , galactorrhoea and risk for patients with prolactin-dependent tumours such as pituitary gland prolactinoma and breast cancer ) .
Overall , the restriction to limit the use of veralipride to 3 months in combination with monthly medical neurological examinations and breast monitoring is not considered adequate to limit the risk of all adverse effects reported with veralipride and adequately treat the vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
In addition , some of these side effects can occur not only during treatment , but also after it is stopped and it is also impossible to predict which women may be at risk .

The CHMP therefore concluded on 19 July 2007 that the benefit / risk balance of veralipride containing medicinal products is not positive under normal conditions of use .
Therefore , the CHMP recommended the withdrawal of all Marketing Authorisations for medicinal products containing veralipride throughout Europe .
GROUNDS FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MA
Whereas
• The Committee considered the referral made under article 31 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , as amended , for medicinal products containing veralipride • The Committee considered that veralipride containing medicinal products only showed limited efficacy in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause ; • The Committee considered that neurological reactions ( dyskinesia , extrapyramidal disorder , Parkinson syndrome ) and psychiatric reactions ( depression , anxiety , withdrawal syndrome ) have been reported with veralipride , including tardive dyskinesia which may be potentially irreversible .
In addition , hyperprolactinemia and the risk of QT prolongation are also concerns ; • The Committee concluded , in view of available data , that the risks associated with the use of veralipride in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause outweigh the limited benefits .
In addition , the Committee considered that the proposed risk minimisation activities were not able to reduce the risks to an acceptable level or predict which women may be at risk ; • The Committee , as a consequence , concluded that the benefit / risk balance of veralipride containing medicinal products is not positive under normal conditions of use .
The CHMP has recommended the withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisations for the medicinal products containing veralipride referred to in Annex I .
