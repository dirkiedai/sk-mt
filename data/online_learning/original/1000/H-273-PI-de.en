CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Rapamune is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant .
It is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months .
Rapamune may be continued as maintenance therapy with corticosteroids only if ciclosporin microemulsion can be progressively discontinued ( see sections 4.2 and 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Rapamune is for oral use only .
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the guidance of an appropriately qualified specialist in transplantation .
Use in adults Initial therapy ( 2 to 3 months post-transplantation ) :
The usual dosage regimen for Rapamune is a 6 mg oral loading dose , administered as soon as possible after transplantation , followed by 2 mg once daily .
The Rapamune dose should then be individualised , to obtain whole blood trough levels of 4 to 12 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune therapy should be optimised with a tapering regimen of steroids and ciclosporin microemulsion .
Suggested ciclosporin trough concentration ranges for the first 2-3 months after transplantation are 150-400 ng / ml ( monoclonal assay or equivalent technique ) .
Maintenance Therapy :
Ciclosporin should be progressively discontinued over 4 to 8 weeks and the Rapamune dose should be adjusted to obtain whole blood trough levels of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune should be given with corticosteroids .
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
2 Use in black recipients :
There is limited information indicating that black renal transplant recipients ( predominantly African-American ) require higher doses and trough levels of sirolimus to achieve the same efficacy as observed in non-black patients .
Currently , the efficacy and safety data are too limited to allow specific recommendations for use of sirolimus in black recipients .
Use in children and adolescents ( &lt; 18 years ) :
The available data on safety and efficacy are not sufficient to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Limited pharmacokinetic information is available in children and adolescents ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years ) :
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
Use in patients with renal impairment :
No dosage adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in patients with hepatic impairment :
The clearance of sirolimus may be reduced in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , it is recommended that the maintenance dose of Rapamune be reduced by approximately one half .
It is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
It is not necessary to modify the Rapamune loading dose .
Therapeutic drug monitoring :
Most patients who received 2 mg of Rapamune 4 hours after ciclosporin had whole blood trough concentrations of sirolimus within the 4 to 12 ng / ml target range ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) .
Optimal therapy requires therapeutic drug concentration monitoring in all patients .
Whole blood sirolimus levels should be closely monitored in the following populations :
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting sirolimus therapy .
Careful attention should be made to clinical signs / symptoms , tissue biopsies , and laboratory parameters .
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Optimally , adjustments in Rapamune dosage should be based on more than a single trough level obtained &gt; 5 days after a previous dosing change .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
On average , the sirolimus dose will need to be 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
The rate at which the dose of sirolimus is increased should correspond to the rate of ciclosporin elimination .
If further dose adjustment ( s ) are required during maintenance therapy ( after discontinuation of ciclosporin ) , in most patients these adjustments can be based on simple proportion : new Rapamune dose = current dose x ( target concentration / current concentration ) .
A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to considerably increase sirolimus trough concentrations :
Rapamune loading dose = 3 x ( new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose ) . The
3 maximum Rapamune dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg .
If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose , the loading dose should be administered over 2 days .
Sirolimus trough concentrations should be monitored at least 3 to 4 days after a loading dose ( s ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , monitoring should be performed every 5 to 7 days until 3 consecutive trough levels have shown stable concentrations of sirolimus after dose adjustment or after loading dose due to the delay in reaching steady state because of the prolonged half-life .
The recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods .
Several assay methodologies have been used to measure the whole blood concentrations of sirolimus .
Currently in clinical practice , sirolimus whole blood concentration are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies .
The concentration values obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable .
When using a proprietary immunoassay system , always refer to the manufacturer &quot; s information to correlate values to a reference chromatographic assay .
All sirolimus concentrations reported in this Summary of Product Characteristics were either measured using chromatographic methods or have been converted to chromatographic method equivalents .
Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay being utilised to determine the sirolimus trough concentrations .
Other considerations for use :
Ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) and other medicinal or non-medicinal products may interact with sirolimus ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Rapamune has not been adequately studied in patients at high immunological risk ( see section 5.1 ) .
Concomitant use with other immunosuppressive agents Sirolimus has been administered concurrently with the following agents in clinical studies : ciclosporin , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , corticosteroids and cytotoxic antibodies .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
Based on information from subsequent clinical trials , the use of Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids , in combination with IL-2 receptor antibody ( IL2R Ab ) induction , is not recommended in the de novo renal transplant setting ( see section 5.1 ) .
Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination .
During treatment with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , vaccination may be less effective .
The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Rapamune .
In hepatically impaired patients , it is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , reduction in maintenance dose by one half is recommended based on decreased clearance ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Since half-life is prolonged in these patients , therapeutic drug monitoring after a loading dose or a change of dose should be performed for a prolonged period of time until stable concentrations are reached ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin or clarithromycin ) or inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin , rifabutin ) is not recommended ( see section 4.5 ) .
4 Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin , may result from immunosuppression ( see section 4.8 ) .
Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection including opportunistic infections , fatal infections , and sepsis .
Patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) .
Among these conditions are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms .
The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients , and therefore , such use is not recommended .
In two clinical studies in de novo liver transplant patients the use of sirolimus plus ciclosporin or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis , mostly leading to graft loss or death .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg / m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature .
There have also been reports of fluid accumulation , including peripheral oedema , lymphoedema , pleural effusion , and pericardial effusions ( including haemodynamically significant effusions in children and adults ) , in patients receiving Rapamune .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema , exfoliative dermatitis , and hypersensitivity vasculitis , have been associated with the administration of sirolimus ( see section 4.8 ) .
In rare cases , the concomitant administration of sirolimus and ACE inhibitors has resulted in angioneurotic oedema-type reactions .
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis .
Therefore , antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for the first 12 months following transplantation .
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation , particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease .
The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including
5 Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
In clinical trials , the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and / or fibrates was well tolerated .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Renal function should be monitored during concomitant administration of Rapamune and ciclosporin .
Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppression regimen should be considered in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels .
Caution should be exercised when co-administering other agents that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
The continued co-administration of ciclosporin and Rapamune as maintenance therapy cannot be recommended .
In patients with delayed graft function , sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported in 2 % of the patients in the study ( see section 4.8 ) .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established .
The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome / thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura / thrombotic microangiopathy ( HUS / TTP / TMA ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme in the intestinal wall and liver .
Sirolimus is also a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) located in the small intestine .
Therefore , absorption and the subsequent elimination of sirolimus may be influenced by substances that affect these proteins .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin , or clarithromycin ) decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus levels .
Inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin or rifabutin ) increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus levels .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ciclosporin ( CYP3A4 substrate ) :
The rate and extent of sirolimus absorption was significantly increased by ciclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
The effect of CsA was also reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax and tmax .
When given 2 hours before CsA administration , sirolimus Cmax and AUC were not affected .
Single-dose sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) in healthy volunteers when administered simultaneously or 4 hours apart .
It is recommended that Rapamune be administered 4 hours after ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) .
6 Rifampicin ( CYP3A4 inducer ) :
Administration of multiple doses of rifampicin decreased sirolimus whole blood concentrations following a single 10 mg dose of Rapamune oral solution .
Rifampicin increased the clearance of sirolimus by approximately 5.5-fold and decreased AUC and Cmax by approximately 82 % and 71 % , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and rifampicin is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and ketoconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Voriconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Co-administration of sirolimus ( 2 mg single dose ) with multiple-dose administration of oral voriconazole ( 400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day , then 100 mg every 12 hours for 8 days ) in healthy subjects has been reported to increase sirolimus Cmax and AUC by an average of 7-fold and 11-fold respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and voriconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Diltiazem ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
The simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg of Rapamune oral solution and 120 mg of diltiazem significantly affected the bioavailability of sirolimus .
Sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 1.4-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.6-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
If diltiazem is administered , sirolimus blood levels should be monitored and a dose adjustment may be necessary .
Verapamil ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of verapamil and sirolimus oral solution significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 2.3-fold , 1.1-fold , and 2.2-fold , respectively .
Plasma S- ( - ) verapamil Cmax and AUC were both increased 1.5-fold , and tmax was decreased 24 % .
Sirolimus levels should be monitored and appropriate dose reductions of both medications should be considered .
Erythromycin ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of erythromycin and sirolimus oral solution significantly increased the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 4.2-fold , respectively .
The Cmax , tmax , and AUC of plasma erythromycin base were increased 1.6-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.7-fold , respectively .
Oral contraceptives :
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
Although the results of a single dose drug interaction study with an oral contraceptive suggest the lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction , the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Other possible interactions Moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus blood levels ( e. g. calcium channel blockers : nicardipine ; antifungal agents : clotrimazole , fluconazole ; antibiotics : troleandomycin ; other substances : bromocriptine , cimetidine , danazol , protease inhibitors ) .
Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus blood levels ( e. g . St .
John &apos;s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) , anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin ) .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in
7 patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune . Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and should therefore be avoided .
Pharmacokinetic interactions may be observed with gastrointestinal prokinetic agents such as cisapride and metoclopramide .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and any of the following substances : acyclovir , atorvastatin , digoxin , glibenclamide , methylprednisolone , nifedipine , prednisolone , and trimethoprim / sulphamethoxazole .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of sirolimus in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Rapamune should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Effective contraception must be used during Rapamune therapy and for 12 weeks after Rapamune has been stopped .
Following administration of radiolabelled sirolimus , radioactivity is excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether sirolimus is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from sirolimus , nursing should be discontinued during therapy .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions ( occurring in 10 % of patients ) are thrombocytopenia , anaemia , pyrexia , hypertension , hypokalaemia , hypophosphataemia , urinary tract infection , hypercholesterolaemia , hyperglycaemia , hypertriglyceridaemia , abdominal pain , lymphocoele , peripheral oedema , arthralgia , acne , diarrhoea , pain , constipation , nausea , headache , increased blood creatinine , and increased blood lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) .
The incidence of any adverse event ( s ) may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented in the following table by system organ class and frequency of occurrence .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Only events for which there is at least reasonable suspicion of a causal relationship to Rapamune treatment are listed .
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .

Immunosuppression increases the susceptibility to the development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.4 ) .
Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy , as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune .
10 Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
There have been rare reports of fatal hepatic necrosis with elevated trough sirolimus levels .
Cases of interstitial lung disease ( including pneumonitis and infrequently bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia ( BOOP ) and pulmonary fibrosis ) , some fatal , with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune .
In some cases , the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune .
The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus level increases .
Impaired healing following transplant surgery has been reported , including fascial dehiscence , incisional hernia , and anastomotic disruption ( e. g. wound , vascular , airway , ureteral , biliary ) .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS / TTP / TMA .
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has been reported .
In an ongoing study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus ( target levels of 12 - 20 ng / mL ) in maintenance renal transplant patients , enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients ( n = 90 ) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL / min ( see section 5.1 ) .
There was a higher rate of serious adverse events including pneumonia , acute rejection , graft loss and death in this sirolimus treatment arm ( n = 60 , median time post-transplant 36 months ) .
Paediatric population Controlled clinical trials with posology comparable to that currently indicated for the use of Rapamune in adults - that is , use in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months post-transplantation followed by withdrawal of ciclosporin thereafter - have not been conducted in children or adolescents ( 18 years of age ) .
Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered of high-immunologic risk , defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy ( see section 5.1 ) .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections .
The treatment regimen studied ( continuous use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitor ) is not indicated for adult or paediatric patients ( see section 4.1 ) .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
Among 89 patients known to be EBV seronegative prior to transplantation , 13 ( 15.6 % ) were reported to have developed PTLD .
All patients who developed PTLD were aged 18 years .
There is insufficient experience to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents ( see section 4.2 ) .
11 4.9 Overdose
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
One patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation after ingestion of 150 mg of Rapamune .
In general , the adverse effects of overdose are consistent with those listed in section 4.8 .
General supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of overdose .
Based on the poor aqueous solubility and high erythrocyte and plasma protein binding of Rapamune , it is anticipated that Rapamune will not be dialysable to any significant extent .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : selective immunosuppressant agents .
ATC code :
L04A A10 .
Sirolimus inhibits T cell activation induced by most stimuli , by blocking calcium dependent and calcium independent intracellular signal transduction .
Studies demonstrated that its effects are mediated by a mechanism that is different from that of ciclosporin , tacrolimus , and other immunosuppressive agents .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
The inhibition of mTOR results in blockage of several specific signal transduction pathways .
The net result is the inhibition of lymphocyte activation , which results in immunosuppression .
In animals , sirolimus has a direct effect on T and B cell activation suppressing immune mediated reactions such as allograft rejection .
Clinical Trials Patients at low to moderate immunological risk were studied in the phase 3 ciclosporin elimination-Rapamune maintenance trial , which included patients receiving a renal allograft from a cadaveric or living donor .
In addition , re-transplant recipients whose previous grafts survived for at least 6 months after transplantation were included .
Ciclosporin was not withdrawn in patients experiencing Banff Grade 3 acute rejection episodes , who were dialysis-dependent , who had a serum creatinine &gt; 400 mol / l , or who had inadequate renal function to support ciclosporin withdrawal .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
At 12 , 24 and 36 months , graft and patient survival were similar for both groups .
At 48 months , there was a statistically significant difference in graft survival in favour of the Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination group compared to the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group ( including and excluding loss to follow-up ) .
There was a significantly higher rate of first biopsy-proven rejection in the ciclosporin elimination group compared to the ciclosporin maintenance group during the period post-randomisation to 12 months ( 9.8 % vs .
4.2 % , respectively ) .
Thereafter , the difference between the two groups was not significant .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group .
Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
By 60 months , the incidence of non-skin malignancies was significantly higher in the cohort who continued ciclosporin as compared with the cohort who had ciclosporin withdrawn
12 ( 8.4 % vs. 3.8 % , respectively ) .
For skin carcinoma , the median time to first occurrence was significantly delayed .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients ( 6-120 months after transplantation ) was assessed in a randomised , multicentre , controlled trial , stratified by calculated GFR at baseline ( 20-40 mL / min vs &gt; 40 mL / min ) .
Concomitant immunosuppressive agents included mycophenolate mofetil , azathioprine , and corticosteroids .
Enrollment in the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &lt; 40 mL / min was discontinued due to an imbalance in safety events ( see section 4.8 ) .
In the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , renal function was not improved overall .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar at 1 and 2 years .
Treatment emergent adverse events occurred more frequently during the first 6 months after Rapamune conversion .
In the stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , the mean and median urinary protein to creatinine ratios were significantly higher in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to those of the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group at 24 months ( see section 4.4 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
At 2 years , the rate of non-melanoma skin malignancies was significantly lower in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group ( 1.8 % and 6.9 % ) .
In a subset of the study patients with a baseline GFR &gt; 40 mL / min and normal urinary protein excretion , calculated GFR was higher at 1 and 2 years in patients converted to Rapamune than for the corresponding subset of calcineurin inhibitor continuation patients .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar , but urinary protein excretion was increased in the Rapamune treatment arm of this subset .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal function was not better in the treatment arms with de novo Rapamune without a calcineurin inhibitor .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Rapamune was assessed in a 36-month controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered at high-immunologic risk , defined as having a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
The Rapamune group failed to demonstrate superiority to the control group in terms of the first occurrence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection , graft loss , or death .
One death occurred in each group .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and total cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections ( see section 4.8 ) .
An unacceptably high frequency of PTLD was seen in a paediatric clinical transplant study when full dose Rapamune was administered to children and adolescents in addition to full dose calcineurin inhibitors with basiliximab and corticosteroids ( see section 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
The systemic availability of sirolimus in combination with simultaneously administered ciclosporin ( Sandimune ) is approximately 14 % . Upon repeated
13 administration , the average blood concentration of sirolimus is increased approximately 3-fold .
The terminal half-life in stable renal transplant patients after multiple oral doses was 62 16h .
The effective half-life , however , is shorter and mean steady-state concentrations were achieved after 5 to 7 days .
The blood to plasma ratio ( B / P ) of 36 indicates that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for sirolimus obtained from 19 renal transplant patients receiving microemulsion ciclosporin ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune ) and corticosteroids , following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune solution in a phase III clinical trial , were ; Cmax , ss 12.2 6.2 ng / ml , tmax , ss 3.01 2.40h , AUC , ss 158 70 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 182 72 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
There was no significant difference in any of these parameters over time up to 6 months after transplantation .
Mean sirolimus whole blood trough levels from the same phase III trial were 7.2 ng / ml ( 4.0 to 11 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 226 ) for the 2 mg per day dose and 14 ng / ml ( 8.0 to 22 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 219 ) for the 5 mg per day dose ( see section 4.2 ) .
Sirolimus is a substrate for both cytochrome P450 IIIA4 ( CYP3A4 ) and P-glycoprotein .
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by O-demethylation and / or hydroxylation .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
Sirolimus is the major component in human whole blood and contributes to greater than 90 % of the immunosuppressive activity .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
In healthy volunteers , a high fat meal altered the bioavailability characteristics of oral liquid sirolimus .
There was a 34 % decrease in the peak blood sirolimus concentration ( Cmax ) , a 3.5-fold increase in the time to peak concentration ( tmax ) , and a 35 % increase in total exposure ( AUC ) .
It is recommended that Rapamune be taken consistently either with or without food .
The use of orange juice and water to dilute Rapamune were equivalent with respect to Cmax , and AUC .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and must therefore be avoided .
In paediatric patients on dialysis ( 30 % to 50 % reduction in glomerular filtration rate ) within age ranges of 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years , the mean weight-normalised CL / F was larger for younger paediatric patients ( 580 ml / h / kg ) than for older paediatric patients ( 450 ml / h / kg ) as compared with adults ( 287 ml / h / kg ) .
There was a large variability for individuals within the age groups .
Sirolimus concentrations were measured in concentration-controlled trials of paediatric renal-transplant patients who were also receiving ciclosporin and corticosteroids .
The target for trough concentrations was 10-20 ng / mL .
At steady state , 8 children aged 6-11 years received mean SD doses of 1.75 0.71 mg / day ( 0.064 0.018 mg / kg , 1.65 0.43 mg / m2 ) while 14 adolescents aged 12-18 years received mean SD doses of 2.79 1.25 mg / day ( 0.053 0.0150 mg / kg , 1.86 0.61 mg / m2 ) .
The younger children had a higher weight-normalized Cl / F ( 214 mL / h / kg ) compared with the adolescents ( 136 mL / h / kg ) .
These data indicate that younger children might require higher bodyweight-adjusted doses than adolescents and adults to achieve similar target concentrations .
However , the development of such special dosing recommendations for children requires more data to be definitely confirmed .
In mild and moderate hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification A or B ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 61 % and 43 % , respectively , and CL / F was decreased 33 % compared to normal healthy subjects .
In severe hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification C ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 210 % and 170 % respectively , and CL / F was
14 decreased by 67 % compared to normal healthy subjects . The longer half-lives observed in hepatically impaired patients delay reaching steady state .
The pharmacokinetics of sirolimus were similar in various populations with renal function ranging from normal to absent ( dialysis patients ) .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies , but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows : pancreatic islet cell vacuolation , testicular tubular degeneration , gastrointestinal ulceration , bone fractures and calluses , hepatic haematopoiesis , and pulmonary phospholipidosis .
Sirolimus was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays , the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay , the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Carcinogenicity studies conducted in mouse and rat showed increased incidences of lymphomas ( male and female mouse ) , hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma ( male mouse ) and granulocytic leukaemia ( female mouse ) .
It is known that malignancies ( lymphoma ) secondary to the chronic use of immunosuppressive agents can occur and have been reported in patients in rare instances .
In mouse , chronic ulcerative skin lesions were increased .
The changes may be related to chronic immunosuppression .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
Partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were reported in a 13-week rat study .
Reductions in testicular weights and / or histological lesions ( e. g. tubular atrophy and tubular giant cells ) were observed in rats and in a monkey study .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) .

Rapamune 1 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 1 mg sirolimus .
Coated tablet .
White coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 1 mg &quot; on one side .
Bioavailability has not been determined for tablets after they have been crushed , chewed or split and therefore this cannot be recommended .
Maintenance therapy :
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
Clinical studies with Rapamune oral solution did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Rapamune tablets administered to 12 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age also gave similar results to adult patients ( n = 167 ) 18 to 65 years of age .
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
To minimize variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients can be switched from the solution to the tablet formulation on a mg per mg basis .
It is recommended that a trough concentration be taken 1 or 2 weeks after switching formulations or tablet strength to confirm that the trough concentration is within the recommended target range .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and
19 consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
Sirolimus tablets contain sucrose and lactose .
In those patients with a history of sucrase insufficiency , isomaltase insufficiency , fructose intolerance , glucose malabsorption , galactose malabsorption , galactose intolerance ( e. g . , galactosemia ) , or Lapp lactase deficiency , a careful risk / benefit assessment should be performed prior to prescribing sirolimus tablets .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure from Rapamune oral solution as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between Rapamune oral solution and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
23 the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune .
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Sepsis Pneumonia Pyelonephritis Herpes simplex Fungal , viral , and bacterial infections ( such as mycobacterial infections , including tuberculosis , Epstein-Barr virus , CMV , and Herpes zoster )
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hypophosphataemia Hypercholesterolaemia Hyperglycaemia Hypertriglyceridaemia
Vascular disorders Respiratory , thoracic , and mediastinal disorders
Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary haemorrhage
Hepatoxicity has been reported .
The risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune
28 with ciclosporin therapy group . Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
Much of the general pharmacokinetic information was obtained using the oral solution , which is summarised first .
Information directly related to the tablet formulation is summarised specifically in the Oral Tablet section .
Oral solution Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
30 Oral Tablet In healthy subjects , the mean extent of bioavailability of sirolimus after single-dose administration of the tablet formulation is about 27 % higher relative to the oral solution .
The mean Cmax was decreased by 35 % and mean tmax increased by 82 % .
The difference in bioavailability was less marked upon steady-state administration to renal transplant recipients , and therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated in randomised study of 477 patients .
When switching patients between oral solution and tablet formulations , it is recommended to give the same dose and to verify the sirolimus trough concentration 1 to 2 weeks later to assure that it remains within recommended target ranges .
Also when switching between different tablet strengths , verification of trough concentrations is recommended .
In 24 healthy volunteers receiving Rapamune tablets with a high-fat meal , Cmax , tmax and AUC showed increases of 65 % , 32 % , and 23 % , respectively .
To minimise variability , Rapamune tablets should be taken consistently with or without food .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and must , therefore , be avoided .
Sirolimus concentrations , following the administration of Rapamune tablets ( 5 mg ) to healthy subjects as single doses are dose proportional between 5 and 40 mg .
In most patients receiving Rapamune tablets with a loading dose of 6 mg followed by an initial maintenance dose of 2 mg , whole blood sirolimus trough concentrations rapidly achieved steady-state concentrations within the recommended target range ( 4 to 12 ng / ml , chromatographic assay ) .
Sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune tablets administered in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune tablets ) and corticosteroids in 13 renal transplant patients , based on data collected at months 1 and 3 after transplantation , were :
Cmin , ss , 7.39 2.18 ng / ml ; Cmax , ss , 15.0 4.9 ng / ml ; tmax , ss , 3.46 2.40 h ; AUC , ss , 230 67 ng h / ml ; CL / F / WT , 139 63 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
The corresponding results for the oral solution in the same clinical trial were Cmin , ss 5.40 2.50 ng / ml , Cmax , ss 14.4 5.3 ng / ml , tmax , ss 2.12 0.84 h , AUC , ss 194 78 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 173 50 ml / h / kg .
Whole blood trough sirolimus concentrations , as measured by LC / MS / MS , were significantly correlated ( r2 = 0.85 ) with AUC , ss .
Based on monitoring in all patients during the period of concomitant therapy with ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 8.6 3.0 ng / ml ( 5.0 to 13 ng / ml ) and 2.1 0.70 mg ( 1.5 to 2.7 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
From month 3 to month 12 , following discontinuation of ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 19 4.1 ng / ml ( 14 to 24 ng / mL ) and 8.2 4.2 mg ( 3.6 to 13.6 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
Therefore , the sirolimus dose was approximately 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction with ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) . ( see section 4.6 ) .

Rapamune 2 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 2 mg sirolimus .
Yellow to beige coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 2 mg &quot; on one side .
Maintenance therapy :
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .

Further information
WHAT RAPAMUNE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Rapamune belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants .
It helps to control your body &quot; s immune system after you have received an organ transplant .
It is used to prevent your body from rejecting transplanted kidneys and is normally used with medicines called corticosteroids and initially with ciclosporin .
BEFORE YOU TAKE RAPAMUNE
Do not take Rapamune if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to sirolimus or any of the other ingredients of Rapamune .
Take special care with Rapamune if you have any liver problems or have had a disease which may have affected your liver , please tell your doctor as this may affect the dose of Rapamune that you receive. immunosuppressive medicines may decrease your body &quot; s ability to fight infection , and may increase the risk of developing cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin .
Your doctor will perform tests to monitor the levels of Rapamune in your blood .
Your doctor will also perform tests to monitor your kidney function and , possibly , your liver function , during therapy with Rapamune .
Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor because of the increased risk for skin cancer .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , or have recently taken any other medicines , including those obtained without a prescription .
Some medicines can interfere with the action of
67 Rapamune .
In particular , you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following : any other immunosuppressive agents excluding ciclosporin or corticosteroids. antibiotics or antifungal medicines used to treat infection e. g. rifampicin , clarithromycin , erythromycin , telithromycin , troleandomycin , rifabutin , clotrimazole , fluconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole and voriconazole. high blood pressure medicines or medicines for heart problems including nicardipine , verapamil and diltiazem. anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin. medicines used to treat-ulcers or other gastrointestinal disorders such as cisapride , cimetidine , metoclopramide. bromocriptine ( used in the treatment of Parkinsons &quot; disease and various hormonal disorders ) , danazol ( used in the treatment of gynaecological disorders ) , or protease inhibitors ( used in the treatment of HIV ) . St. John &quot; s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) .
The use of Rapamune may lead to increased blood concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Medicines known as &quot; statins &quot; and &quot; fibrates &quot; used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of muscle breakdown ( rhabdomyolysis ) .
Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs to lower your blood fats .
Taking Rapamune with food and drink Rapamune should be taken consistently , either with or without food .
Rapamune should be diluted only with water or orange juice .

If you are unsure , or think you may have become pregnant , talk to your doctor .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
Decreased sperm count has been associated with the use of Rapamune and usually resolves after discontinuation .
It is not known whether Rapamune passes into breast milk .
Patients taking Rapamune should discontinue breast-feeding .
Use in children and adolescents There is limited experience with the administration of Rapamune in children and adolescents .
Driving and using machines No specific studies on the effects of Rapamune on the ability to drive and use machines have been conducted .

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines , Rapamune can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
However , since Rapamune is taken in combination with other medicines , the side effects cannot always be attributed with absolute certainty to Rapamune .
When taken with medicines called calcineurin inhibitors ( ciclosporin or tacrolimus ) , Rapamune may increase the risk of kidney damage with low blood platelets and low red blood cell counts with or without rash ( thrombocytopenic purpura / haemolytic uraemic syndrome ) .
Immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , reduce your body &quot; s own defence mechanisms to stop you rejecting your transplanted organ .
Consequently your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections .
So if you are taking Rapamune you may therefore catch more infections than usual such as infections of the skin , mouth , stomach and intestines , lungs and urinary tract .
