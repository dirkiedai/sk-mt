CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
Manic episode :
The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
For patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
If a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
2 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
A greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
Dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( See sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6-12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
3 CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment . The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with
4 myeloproliferative disease . Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported ..
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Lactose ZYPREXA tablets contain lactose .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
5 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
6 olanzapine . Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed
across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories . Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
8 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
9 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( ≥ 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
Common :
Elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
Sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
Gastrointestinal disorders Common :
Dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
Elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
Decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained ≥ 15 % and almost a third gained ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
Induction of emesis is not recommended .
Standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 % .
10 Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5 HT2A / 2C , 5 HT3 , 5 HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α 1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence . Olanzapine also
11 showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone , olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence ( olanzapine 30.0 % , lithium 38.3 % ; p = 0.055 ) .
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser ( lithium or valproate ) , long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence , defined according to syndromic ( diagnostic ) criteria .
Paediatric population The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
The absorption is not affected by food .
Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
After oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
However , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
12 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
However , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α 1-acid-glycoprotein .
Paediatric population Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) :
The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
In clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 % higher in adolescents .
Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
Reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Estrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

ZYPREXA 10 mg powder for solution for injection
Each vial contains 10 mg olanzapine .
After reconstitution each ml of the solution contains 5 mg olanzapine .
Powder for solution for injection Yellow lyophilised powder .
Adults ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or manic episode , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
Treatment with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection should be discontinued and the use of oral olanzapine should be initiated as soon as clinically appropriate .
Adults For intramuscular use .
Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is intended for short term use only , for up to a maximum of three consecutive days .
The maximum daily dose of olanzapine ( including all formulations of olanzapine ) is 20 mg .
The recommended initial dose for olanzapine injection is 10 mg , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
A lower dose ( 5 mg or 7.5 mg ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
A second injection , 5-10 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection on the basis of individual clinical status .
Not more than three injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of olanzapine of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) should not be exceeded .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection should be reconstituted in accordance with the recommendation in section 6.6 .
For further information on continued treatment with oral olanzapine ( 5 to 20 mg daily ) , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ZYPREXA coated tablets or ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablets .
Children and adolescents There is no experience in children .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
86 Elderly The recommended starting dose in elderly patients ( &gt; 60 years ) is 2.5 - 5 mg .
Depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status ( see section 4.4 ) , a second injection , 2.5 - 5 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection .
Not more than 3 injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) of olanzapine should not be exceeded .
The efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been established in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours related to conditions other than schizophrenia or manic episode .
Unstable medical conditions IM olanzapine should not be administered to patients with unstable medical conditions , such as acute myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , severe hypotension and / or bradycardia , sick sinus syndrome , or following heart surgery .
If the patient &quot; s medical history with regard to these unstable medical conditions cannot be determined , the risks and benefits of IM olanzapine should be considered in relation to other alternative treatments .
Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other medicinal products Special caution is necessary in patients who have received treatment with other medicinal products having haemodynamic properties similar to those of intramuscular olanzapine including other antipsychotics ( oral and / or intramuscular ) and benzodiazepines ( see section 4.5 ) .
Temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory depression and death has been very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) reported particularly in patients who have received benzodiazepines and / or other antipsychotics ( see section 4.8 ) .
Simultaneous injection of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.5 and 6.2 ) .
If the patient is considered to need parenteral benzodiazepine treatment , this should not be given until at least one hour after IM olanzapine administration .
If the patient has received parenteral benzodiazepine , IM olanzapine administration should only be considered after careful evaluation of clinical status and the patient should be closely monitored for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
87 Hypotension It is extremely important that patients receiving intramuscular olanzapine should be closely observed for hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation , particularly for the first 4 hours following injection and close observation should be continued after this period if clinically indicated .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be observed regularly and remedial treatment provided if required .
Patients should remain recumbent if dizzy or drowsy after injection until examination indicates that they are not experiencing hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation .
The safety and efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit drugs ) ( see section 4.5 ) .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during oral clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral administration , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
In clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection , olanzapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT or in QTc intervals .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
89 General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator oral studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in oral olanzapine clinical trials .
IM olanzapine has not been studied in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( see section 4.4 ) .
Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can induce hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory or central nervous system depression ( see section 4.4 ) .
Potential for interaction following intramuscular injection In a single dose intramuscular study of olanzapine 5 mg , administered 1 hour before intramuscular lorazepam 2 mg ( metabolised by glucuronidation ) , the pharmacokinetics of both medicines were unchanged .
However , the combination added to the somnolence observed with either medicines alone .
Concomitant injection of olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 6.2 ) .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
90 Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists ( see section 6.2 ) .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
A common ( 1-10 % ) undesirable effect associated with the use of intramuscular olanzapine in clinical trials was somnolence .
In post marketing reports , temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with cases of respiratory depression , hypotension or bradycardia and death have been very rarely reported , mostly in patients who concomitantly received benzodiazepines , and / or other antipsychotic medicinal products or who were treated in excess of olanzapine recommended daily doses ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
91 The following table is based on the undesirable effects and laboratory investigations from clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection rather than oral olanzapine .
Cardiac disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Bradycardia with or without hypotension or syncope , tachycardia . Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Sinus pause . Vascular Disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Postural hypotension , hypotension . Respiratory disorders Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Hypoventilation . General disorders and administration site conditions Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Injection site discomfort .
The undesirable effects listed below have been observed following administration of oral olanzapine , but may also occur following administration of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
Tardive dyskinesia Discontinuation symptoms7 Cardiac disorders Vascular disorders
Bradycardia QTc prolongation ( see section 4.4 )
Ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation , sudden death ( see section 4.4 )
Gastrointestinal disorders
93 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
94 Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with oral olanzapine in over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary
95 analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring oral olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , oral olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Oral olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers , a dose of 5 mg of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection produced a maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) approximately 5 times higher than that seen with the same dose of olanzapine administered orally .
The Cmax occurs earlier after intramuscular compared to oral use ( 15 to 45 minutes versus 5 to 8 hours ) .
As with oral use , Cmax and area under the curve after intramuscular use are directly proportional to the dose administered .
For the same dose of olanzapine administered intramuscularly and orally , the associated area under the curve , half-life , clearance and volume of distribution are similar .
The metabolic profiles following intramuscular and oral use are similar .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) administered olanzapine intramuscularly the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
Additional pharmacokinetic data following administration of oral olanzapine are described below .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects administered oral olanzapine , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
96 In female versus male subjects administered oral olanzapine the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects administered oral olanzapine , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction administered olanzapine orally , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , laboured respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of oral studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Rapamune is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant .
It is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months .
Rapamune may be continued as maintenance therapy with corticosteroids only if ciclosporin microemulsion can be progressively discontinued ( see sections 4.2 and 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Rapamune is for oral use only .
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the guidance of an appropriately qualified specialist in transplantation .
Use in adults Initial therapy ( 2 to 3 months post-transplantation ) :
The usual dosage regimen for Rapamune is a 6 mg oral loading dose , administered as soon as possible after transplantation , followed by 2 mg once daily .
The Rapamune dose should then be individualised , to obtain whole blood trough levels of 4 to 12 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune therapy should be optimised with a tapering regimen of steroids and ciclosporin microemulsion .
Suggested ciclosporin trough concentration ranges for the first 2-3 months after transplantation are 150-400 ng / ml ( monoclonal assay or equivalent technique ) .
Maintenance Therapy :
Ciclosporin should be progressively discontinued over 4 to 8 weeks and the Rapamune dose should be adjusted to obtain whole blood trough levels of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune should be given with corticosteroids .
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
2 Use in black recipients :
There is limited information indicating that black renal transplant recipients ( predominantly African-American ) require higher doses and trough levels of sirolimus to achieve the same efficacy as observed in non-black patients .
Currently , the efficacy and safety data are too limited to allow specific recommendations for use of sirolimus in black recipients .
Use in children and adolescents ( &lt; 18 years ) :
The available data on safety and efficacy are not sufficient to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Limited pharmacokinetic information is available in children and adolescents ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years ) :
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
Use in patients with renal impairment :
No dosage adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in patients with hepatic impairment :
The clearance of sirolimus may be reduced in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , it is recommended that the maintenance dose of Rapamune be reduced by approximately one half .
It is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
It is not necessary to modify the Rapamune loading dose .
Therapeutic drug monitoring :
Most patients who received 2 mg of Rapamune 4 hours after ciclosporin had whole blood trough concentrations of sirolimus within the 4 to 12 ng / ml target range ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) .
Optimal therapy requires therapeutic drug concentration monitoring in all patients .
Whole blood sirolimus levels should be closely monitored in the following populations :
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting sirolimus therapy .
Careful attention should be made to clinical signs / symptoms , tissue biopsies , and laboratory parameters .
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Optimally , adjustments in Rapamune dosage should be based on more than a single trough level obtained &gt; 5 days after a previous dosing change .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
On average , the sirolimus dose will need to be 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
The rate at which the dose of sirolimus is increased should correspond to the rate of ciclosporin elimination .
If further dose adjustment ( s ) are required during maintenance therapy ( after discontinuation of ciclosporin ) , in most patients these adjustments can be based on simple proportion : new Rapamune dose = current dose x ( target concentration / current concentration ) .
A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to considerably increase sirolimus trough concentrations :
Rapamune loading dose = 3 x ( new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose ) . The
3 maximum Rapamune dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg .
If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose , the loading dose should be administered over 2 days .
Sirolimus trough concentrations should be monitored at least 3 to 4 days after a loading dose ( s ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , monitoring should be performed every 5 to 7 days until 3 consecutive trough levels have shown stable concentrations of sirolimus after dose adjustment or after loading dose due to the delay in reaching steady state because of the prolonged half-life .
The recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods .
Several assay methodologies have been used to measure the whole blood concentrations of sirolimus .
Currently in clinical practice , sirolimus whole blood concentration are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies .
The concentration values obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable .
When using a proprietary immunoassay system , always refer to the manufacturer &quot; s information to correlate values to a reference chromatographic assay .
All sirolimus concentrations reported in this Summary of Product Characteristics were either measured using chromatographic methods or have been converted to chromatographic method equivalents .
Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay being utilised to determine the sirolimus trough concentrations .
Other considerations for use :
Ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) and other medicinal or non-medicinal products may interact with sirolimus ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Rapamune has not been adequately studied in patients at high immunological risk ( see section 5.1 ) .
Concomitant use with other immunosuppressive agents Sirolimus has been administered concurrently with the following agents in clinical studies : ciclosporin , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , corticosteroids and cytotoxic antibodies .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
Based on information from subsequent clinical trials , the use of Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids , in combination with IL-2 receptor antibody ( IL2R Ab ) induction , is not recommended in the de novo renal transplant setting ( see section 5.1 ) .
Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination .
During treatment with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , vaccination may be less effective .
The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Rapamune .
In hepatically impaired patients , it is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , reduction in maintenance dose by one half is recommended based on decreased clearance ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Since half-life is prolonged in these patients , therapeutic drug monitoring after a loading dose or a change of dose should be performed for a prolonged period of time until stable concentrations are reached ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin or clarithromycin ) or inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin , rifabutin ) is not recommended ( see section 4.5 ) .
4 Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin , may result from immunosuppression ( see section 4.8 ) .
Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection including opportunistic infections , fatal infections , and sepsis .
Patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) .
Among these conditions are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms .
The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients , and therefore , such use is not recommended .
In two clinical studies in de novo liver transplant patients the use of sirolimus plus ciclosporin or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis , mostly leading to graft loss or death .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg / m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature .
There have also been reports of fluid accumulation , including peripheral oedema , lymphoedema , pleural effusion , and pericardial effusions ( including haemodynamically significant effusions in children and adults ) , in patients receiving Rapamune .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema , exfoliative dermatitis , and hypersensitivity vasculitis , have been associated with the administration of sirolimus ( see section 4.8 ) .
In rare cases , the concomitant administration of sirolimus and ACE inhibitors has resulted in angioneurotic oedema-type reactions .
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis .
Therefore , antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for the first 12 months following transplantation .
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation , particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease .
The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including
5 Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
In clinical trials , the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and / or fibrates was well tolerated .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Renal function should be monitored during concomitant administration of Rapamune and ciclosporin .
Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppression regimen should be considered in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels .
Caution should be exercised when co-administering other agents that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
The continued co-administration of ciclosporin and Rapamune as maintenance therapy cannot be recommended .
In patients with delayed graft function , sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported in 2 % of the patients in the study ( see section 4.8 ) .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established .
The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome / thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura / thrombotic microangiopathy ( HUS / TTP / TMA ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme in the intestinal wall and liver .
Sirolimus is also a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) located in the small intestine .
Therefore , absorption and the subsequent elimination of sirolimus may be influenced by substances that affect these proteins .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin , or clarithromycin ) decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus levels .
Inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin or rifabutin ) increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus levels .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ciclosporin ( CYP3A4 substrate ) :
The rate and extent of sirolimus absorption was significantly increased by ciclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
The effect of CsA was also reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax and tmax .
When given 2 hours before CsA administration , sirolimus Cmax and AUC were not affected .
Single-dose sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) in healthy volunteers when administered simultaneously or 4 hours apart .
It is recommended that Rapamune be administered 4 hours after ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) .
6 Rifampicin ( CYP3A4 inducer ) :
Administration of multiple doses of rifampicin decreased sirolimus whole blood concentrations following a single 10 mg dose of Rapamune oral solution .
Rifampicin increased the clearance of sirolimus by approximately 5.5-fold and decreased AUC and Cmax by approximately 82 % and 71 % , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and rifampicin is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and ketoconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Voriconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Co-administration of sirolimus ( 2 mg single dose ) with multiple-dose administration of oral voriconazole ( 400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day , then 100 mg every 12 hours for 8 days ) in healthy subjects has been reported to increase sirolimus Cmax and AUC by an average of 7-fold and 11-fold respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and voriconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Diltiazem ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
The simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg of Rapamune oral solution and 120 mg of diltiazem significantly affected the bioavailability of sirolimus .
Sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 1.4-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.6-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
If diltiazem is administered , sirolimus blood levels should be monitored and a dose adjustment may be necessary .
Verapamil ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of verapamil and sirolimus oral solution significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 2.3-fold , 1.1-fold , and 2.2-fold , respectively .
Plasma S- ( - ) verapamil Cmax and AUC were both increased 1.5-fold , and tmax was decreased 24 % .
Sirolimus levels should be monitored and appropriate dose reductions of both medications should be considered .
Erythromycin ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of erythromycin and sirolimus oral solution significantly increased the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 4.2-fold , respectively .
The Cmax , tmax , and AUC of plasma erythromycin base were increased 1.6-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.7-fold , respectively .
Oral contraceptives :
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
Although the results of a single dose drug interaction study with an oral contraceptive suggest the lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction , the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Other possible interactions Moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus blood levels ( e. g. calcium channel blockers : nicardipine ; antifungal agents : clotrimazole , fluconazole ; antibiotics : troleandomycin ; other substances : bromocriptine , cimetidine , danazol , protease inhibitors ) .
Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus blood levels ( e. g . St .
John &apos;s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) , anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin ) .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in
7 patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune . Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and should therefore be avoided .
Pharmacokinetic interactions may be observed with gastrointestinal prokinetic agents such as cisapride and metoclopramide .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and any of the following substances : acyclovir , atorvastatin , digoxin , glibenclamide , methylprednisolone , nifedipine , prednisolone , and trimethoprim / sulphamethoxazole .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of sirolimus in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Rapamune should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Effective contraception must be used during Rapamune therapy and for 12 weeks after Rapamune has been stopped .
Following administration of radiolabelled sirolimus , radioactivity is excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether sirolimus is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from sirolimus , nursing should be discontinued during therapy .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

Immunosuppression increases the susceptibility to the development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.4 ) .
Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy , as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune .
10 Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
There have been rare reports of fatal hepatic necrosis with elevated trough sirolimus levels .
Cases of interstitial lung disease ( including pneumonitis and infrequently bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia ( BOOP ) and pulmonary fibrosis ) , some fatal , with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune .
In some cases , the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune .
The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus level increases .
Impaired healing following transplant surgery has been reported , including fascial dehiscence , incisional hernia , and anastomotic disruption ( e. g. wound , vascular , airway , ureteral , biliary ) .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS / TTP / TMA .
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has been reported .
In an ongoing study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus ( target levels of 12 - 20 ng / mL ) in maintenance renal transplant patients , enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients ( n = 90 ) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL / min ( see section 5.1 ) .
There was a higher rate of serious adverse events including pneumonia , acute rejection , graft loss and death in this sirolimus treatment arm ( n = 60 , median time post-transplant 36 months ) .
Paediatric population Controlled clinical trials with posology comparable to that currently indicated for the use of Rapamune in adults - that is , use in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months post-transplantation followed by withdrawal of ciclosporin thereafter - have not been conducted in children or adolescents ( 18 years of age ) .
Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered of high-immunologic risk , defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy ( see section 5.1 ) .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections .
The treatment regimen studied ( continuous use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitor ) is not indicated for adult or paediatric patients ( see section 4.1 ) .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
Among 89 patients known to be EBV seronegative prior to transplantation , 13 ( 15.6 % ) were reported to have developed PTLD .
All patients who developed PTLD were aged 18 years .
There is insufficient experience to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents ( see section 4.2 ) .
11 4.9 Overdose
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
One patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation after ingestion of 150 mg of Rapamune .
In general , the adverse effects of overdose are consistent with those listed in section 4.8 .
General supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of overdose .
Based on the poor aqueous solubility and high erythrocyte and plasma protein binding of Rapamune , it is anticipated that Rapamune will not be dialysable to any significant extent .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : selective immunosuppressant agents .
ATC code :
L04A A10 .
Sirolimus inhibits T cell activation induced by most stimuli , by blocking calcium dependent and calcium independent intracellular signal transduction .
Studies demonstrated that its effects are mediated by a mechanism that is different from that of ciclosporin , tacrolimus , and other immunosuppressive agents .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
The inhibition of mTOR results in blockage of several specific signal transduction pathways .
The net result is the inhibition of lymphocyte activation , which results in immunosuppression .
In animals , sirolimus has a direct effect on T and B cell activation suppressing immune mediated reactions such as allograft rejection .
Clinical Trials Patients at low to moderate immunological risk were studied in the phase 3 ciclosporin elimination-Rapamune maintenance trial , which included patients receiving a renal allograft from a cadaveric or living donor .
In addition , re-transplant recipients whose previous grafts survived for at least 6 months after transplantation were included .
Ciclosporin was not withdrawn in patients experiencing Banff Grade 3 acute rejection episodes , who were dialysis-dependent , who had a serum creatinine &gt; 400 mol / l , or who had inadequate renal function to support ciclosporin withdrawal .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
At 12 , 24 and 36 months , graft and patient survival were similar for both groups .
At 48 months , there was a statistically significant difference in graft survival in favour of the Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination group compared to the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group ( including and excluding loss to follow-up ) .
There was a significantly higher rate of first biopsy-proven rejection in the ciclosporin elimination group compared to the ciclosporin maintenance group during the period post-randomisation to 12 months ( 9.8 % vs .
4.2 % , respectively ) .
Thereafter , the difference between the two groups was not significant .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group .
Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
By 60 months , the incidence of non-skin malignancies was significantly higher in the cohort who continued ciclosporin as compared with the cohort who had ciclosporin withdrawn
12 ( 8.4 % vs. 3.8 % , respectively ) .
For skin carcinoma , the median time to first occurrence was significantly delayed .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients ( 6-120 months after transplantation ) was assessed in a randomised , multicentre , controlled trial , stratified by calculated GFR at baseline ( 20-40 mL / min vs &gt; 40 mL / min ) .
Concomitant immunosuppressive agents included mycophenolate mofetil , azathioprine , and corticosteroids .
Enrollment in the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &lt; 40 mL / min was discontinued due to an imbalance in safety events ( see section 4.8 ) .
In the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , renal function was not improved overall .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar at 1 and 2 years .
Treatment emergent adverse events occurred more frequently during the first 6 months after Rapamune conversion .
In the stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , the mean and median urinary protein to creatinine ratios were significantly higher in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to those of the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group at 24 months ( see section 4.4 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
At 2 years , the rate of non-melanoma skin malignancies was significantly lower in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group ( 1.8 % and 6.9 % ) .
In a subset of the study patients with a baseline GFR &gt; 40 mL / min and normal urinary protein excretion , calculated GFR was higher at 1 and 2 years in patients converted to Rapamune than for the corresponding subset of calcineurin inhibitor continuation patients .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar , but urinary protein excretion was increased in the Rapamune treatment arm of this subset .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal function was not better in the treatment arms with de novo Rapamune without a calcineurin inhibitor .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Rapamune was assessed in a 36-month controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered at high-immunologic risk , defined as having a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
The Rapamune group failed to demonstrate superiority to the control group in terms of the first occurrence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection , graft loss , or death .
One death occurred in each group .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and total cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections ( see section 4.8 ) .
An unacceptably high frequency of PTLD was seen in a paediatric clinical transplant study when full dose Rapamune was administered to children and adolescents in addition to full dose calcineurin inhibitors with basiliximab and corticosteroids ( see section 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
The systemic availability of sirolimus in combination with simultaneously administered ciclosporin ( Sandimune ) is approximately 14 % . Upon repeated
13 administration , the average blood concentration of sirolimus is increased approximately 3-fold .
The terminal half-life in stable renal transplant patients after multiple oral doses was 62 16h .
The effective half-life , however , is shorter and mean steady-state concentrations were achieved after 5 to 7 days .
The blood to plasma ratio ( B / P ) of 36 indicates that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for sirolimus obtained from 19 renal transplant patients receiving microemulsion ciclosporin ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune ) and corticosteroids , following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune solution in a phase III clinical trial , were ; Cmax , ss 12.2 6.2 ng / ml , tmax , ss 3.01 2.40h , AUC , ss 158 70 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 182 72 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
There was no significant difference in any of these parameters over time up to 6 months after transplantation .
Mean sirolimus whole blood trough levels from the same phase III trial were 7.2 ng / ml ( 4.0 to 11 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 226 ) for the 2 mg per day dose and 14 ng / ml ( 8.0 to 22 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 219 ) for the 5 mg per day dose ( see section 4.2 ) .
Sirolimus is a substrate for both cytochrome P450 IIIA4 ( CYP3A4 ) and P-glycoprotein .
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by O-demethylation and / or hydroxylation .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
Sirolimus is the major component in human whole blood and contributes to greater than 90 % of the immunosuppressive activity .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
In healthy volunteers , a high fat meal altered the bioavailability characteristics of oral liquid sirolimus .
There was a 34 % decrease in the peak blood sirolimus concentration ( Cmax ) , a 3.5-fold increase in the time to peak concentration ( tmax ) , and a 35 % increase in total exposure ( AUC ) .
It is recommended that Rapamune be taken consistently either with or without food .
The use of orange juice and water to dilute Rapamune were equivalent with respect to Cmax , and AUC .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and must therefore be avoided .
In paediatric patients on dialysis ( 30 % to 50 % reduction in glomerular filtration rate ) within age ranges of 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years , the mean weight-normalised CL / F was larger for younger paediatric patients ( 580 ml / h / kg ) than for older paediatric patients ( 450 ml / h / kg ) as compared with adults ( 287 ml / h / kg ) .
There was a large variability for individuals within the age groups .
Sirolimus concentrations were measured in concentration-controlled trials of paediatric renal-transplant patients who were also receiving ciclosporin and corticosteroids .
The target for trough concentrations was 10-20 ng / mL .
At steady state , 8 children aged 6-11 years received mean SD doses of 1.75 0.71 mg / day ( 0.064 0.018 mg / kg , 1.65 0.43 mg / m2 ) while 14 adolescents aged 12-18 years received mean SD doses of 2.79 1.25 mg / day ( 0.053 0.0150 mg / kg , 1.86 0.61 mg / m2 ) .
The younger children had a higher weight-normalized Cl / F ( 214 mL / h / kg ) compared with the adolescents ( 136 mL / h / kg ) .
These data indicate that younger children might require higher bodyweight-adjusted doses than adolescents and adults to achieve similar target concentrations .
However , the development of such special dosing recommendations for children requires more data to be definitely confirmed .
In mild and moderate hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification A or B ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 61 % and 43 % , respectively , and CL / F was decreased 33 % compared to normal healthy subjects .
In severe hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification C ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 210 % and 170 % respectively , and CL / F was
14 decreased by 67 % compared to normal healthy subjects . The longer half-lives observed in hepatically impaired patients delay reaching steady state .
The pharmacokinetics of sirolimus were similar in various populations with renal function ranging from normal to absent ( dialysis patients ) .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies , but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows : pancreatic islet cell vacuolation , testicular tubular degeneration , gastrointestinal ulceration , bone fractures and calluses , hepatic haematopoiesis , and pulmonary phospholipidosis .
Sirolimus was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays , the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay , the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Carcinogenicity studies conducted in mouse and rat showed increased incidences of lymphomas ( male and female mouse ) , hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma ( male mouse ) and granulocytic leukaemia ( female mouse ) .
It is known that malignancies ( lymphoma ) secondary to the chronic use of immunosuppressive agents can occur and have been reported in patients in rare instances .
In mouse , chronic ulcerative skin lesions were increased .
The changes may be related to chronic immunosuppression .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
Partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were reported in a 13-week rat study .
Reductions in testicular weights and / or histological lesions ( e. g. tubular atrophy and tubular giant cells ) were observed in rats and in a monkey study .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) .

Rapamune 1 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 1 mg sirolimus .
Coated tablet .
White coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 1 mg &quot; on one side .
Bioavailability has not been determined for tablets after they have been crushed , chewed or split and therefore this cannot be recommended .
Maintenance therapy :
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
Clinical studies with Rapamune oral solution did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Rapamune tablets administered to 12 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age also gave similar results to adult patients ( n = 167 ) 18 to 65 years of age .
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
To minimize variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients can be switched from the solution to the tablet formulation on a mg per mg basis .
It is recommended that a trough concentration be taken 1 or 2 weeks after switching formulations or tablet strength to confirm that the trough concentration is within the recommended target range .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and
19 consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
Sirolimus tablets contain sucrose and lactose .
In those patients with a history of sucrase insufficiency , isomaltase insufficiency , fructose intolerance , glucose malabsorption , galactose malabsorption , galactose intolerance ( e. g . , galactosemia ) , or Lapp lactase deficiency , a careful risk / benefit assessment should be performed prior to prescribing sirolimus tablets .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure from Rapamune oral solution as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between Rapamune oral solution and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
23 the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune .
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Sepsis Pneumonia Pyelonephritis Herpes simplex Fungal , viral , and bacterial infections ( such as mycobacterial infections , including tuberculosis , Epstein-Barr virus , CMV , and Herpes zoster )
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hypophosphataemia Hypercholesterolaemia Hyperglycaemia Hypertriglyceridaemia
Vascular disorders Respiratory , thoracic , and mediastinal disorders
Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary haemorrhage
Hepatoxicity has been reported .
The risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune
28 with ciclosporin therapy group . Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
Much of the general pharmacokinetic information was obtained using the oral solution , which is summarised first .
Information directly related to the tablet formulation is summarised specifically in the Oral Tablet section .
Oral solution Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
30 Oral Tablet In healthy subjects , the mean extent of bioavailability of sirolimus after single-dose administration of the tablet formulation is about 27 % higher relative to the oral solution .
The mean Cmax was decreased by 35 % and mean tmax increased by 82 % .
The difference in bioavailability was less marked upon steady-state administration to renal transplant recipients , and therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated in randomised study of 477 patients .
When switching patients between oral solution and tablet formulations , it is recommended to give the same dose and to verify the sirolimus trough concentration 1 to 2 weeks later to assure that it remains within recommended target ranges .
Also when switching between different tablet strengths , verification of trough concentrations is recommended .
In 24 healthy volunteers receiving Rapamune tablets with a high-fat meal , Cmax , tmax and AUC showed increases of 65 % , 32 % , and 23 % , respectively .
To minimise variability , Rapamune tablets should be taken consistently with or without food .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and must , therefore , be avoided .
Sirolimus concentrations , following the administration of Rapamune tablets ( 5 mg ) to healthy subjects as single doses are dose proportional between 5 and 40 mg .
In most patients receiving Rapamune tablets with a loading dose of 6 mg followed by an initial maintenance dose of 2 mg , whole blood sirolimus trough concentrations rapidly achieved steady-state concentrations within the recommended target range ( 4 to 12 ng / ml , chromatographic assay ) .
Sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune tablets administered in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune tablets ) and corticosteroids in 13 renal transplant patients , based on data collected at months 1 and 3 after transplantation , were :
Cmin , ss , 7.39 2.18 ng / ml ; Cmax , ss , 15.0 4.9 ng / ml ; tmax , ss , 3.46 2.40 h ; AUC , ss , 230 67 ng h / ml ; CL / F / WT , 139 63 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
The corresponding results for the oral solution in the same clinical trial were Cmin , ss 5.40 2.50 ng / ml , Cmax , ss 14.4 5.3 ng / ml , tmax , ss 2.12 0.84 h , AUC , ss 194 78 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 173 50 ml / h / kg .
Whole blood trough sirolimus concentrations , as measured by LC / MS / MS , were significantly correlated ( r2 = 0.85 ) with AUC , ss .
Based on monitoring in all patients during the period of concomitant therapy with ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 8.6 3.0 ng / ml ( 5.0 to 13 ng / ml ) and 2.1 0.70 mg ( 1.5 to 2.7 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
From month 3 to month 12 , following discontinuation of ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 19 4.1 ng / ml ( 14 to 24 ng / mL ) and 8.2 4.2 mg ( 3.6 to 13.6 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
Therefore , the sirolimus dose was approximately 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction with ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) . ( see section 4.6 ) .

Rapamune 2 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 2 mg sirolimus .
Yellow to beige coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 2 mg &quot; on one side .
Maintenance therapy :
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and must , therefore , be avoided .

Further information
WHAT RAPAMUNE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Rapamune belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants .
It helps to control your body &quot; s immune system after you have received an organ transplant .
It is used to prevent your body from rejecting transplanted kidneys and is normally used with medicines called corticosteroids and initially with ciclosporin .
BEFORE YOU TAKE RAPAMUNE
Do not take Rapamune if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to sirolimus or any of the other ingredients of Rapamune .
Take special care with Rapamune if you have any liver problems or have had a disease which may have affected your liver , please tell your doctor as this may affect the dose of Rapamune that you receive. immunosuppressive medicines may decrease your body &quot; s ability to fight infection , and may increase the risk of developing cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin .
Your doctor will perform tests to monitor the levels of Rapamune in your blood .
Your doctor will also perform tests to monitor your kidney function and , possibly , your liver function , during therapy with Rapamune .
Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor because of the increased risk for skin cancer .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , or have recently taken any other medicines , including those obtained without a prescription .
Some medicines can interfere with the action of
67 Rapamune .
In particular , you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following : any other immunosuppressive agents excluding ciclosporin or corticosteroids. antibiotics or antifungal medicines used to treat infection e. g. rifampicin , clarithromycin , erythromycin , telithromycin , troleandomycin , rifabutin , clotrimazole , fluconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole and voriconazole. high blood pressure medicines or medicines for heart problems including nicardipine , verapamil and diltiazem. anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin. medicines used to treat-ulcers or other gastrointestinal disorders such as cisapride , cimetidine , metoclopramide. bromocriptine ( used in the treatment of Parkinsons &quot; disease and various hormonal disorders ) , danazol ( used in the treatment of gynaecological disorders ) , or protease inhibitors ( used in the treatment of HIV ) . St. John &quot; s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) .
The use of Rapamune may lead to increased blood concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Medicines known as &quot; statins &quot; and &quot; fibrates &quot; used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of muscle breakdown ( rhabdomyolysis ) .
Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs to lower your blood fats .
Taking Rapamune with food and drink Rapamune should be taken consistently , either with or without food .
Rapamune should be diluted only with water or orange juice .
Do not take Rapamune with grapefruit juice .
Pregnancy and breast feeding You must use effective contraception methods during treatment with Rapamune and for 12 weeks after treatment has stopped .
If you are unsure , or think you may have become pregnant , talk to your doctor .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
Decreased sperm count has been associated with the use of Rapamune and usually resolves after discontinuation .
It is not known whether Rapamune passes into breast milk .
Patients taking Rapamune should discontinue breast-feeding .
Use in children and adolescents There is limited experience with the administration of Rapamune in children and adolescents .
Driving and using machines No specific studies on the effects of Rapamune on the ability to drive and use machines have been conducted .
Although Rapamune treatment is not expected to affect your ability to drive , if you have any concerns please consult your doctor .
Important information about one of the ingredients of Rapamune WARNING :
This medicine contains 1.5 % to 2.5 % ethanol .
Each 2 mg dose contains up to 50 mg of alcohol .
Alcohol may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism , epilepsy , brain injury or disease as well as for pregnant women and children .
Alcohol may modify or increase the effect of other medicines .
HOW TO TAKE RAPAMUNE
Rapamune is for oral use only .
Always take Rapamune exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
Your doctor will decide exactly what dose of Rapamune you must take and how often to take it .
Follow your doctor &quot; s instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself .
Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to .
If you stop taking your medicine , you risk losing your transplant .
Usually for an adult your doctor will give you an initial dose of 6 mg at the time of the kidney transplant operation .
Then you will need to take 2 mg of Rapamune each day , unless otherwise directed by your doctor .
Your dose will be adjusted depending on the level of Rapamune in your blood .
Your doctor will need to perform a blood test to measure Rapamune concentrations .
If you are also taking ciclosporin , then you must take the two medicines approximately 4 hours apart .
Instructions on how to dilute Rapamune
Remove the safety cap from the bottle by squeezing the tabs on the cap and twisting .
Insert the syringe adapter into the bottle until it is flush with the top of the bottle .
Do not attempt to remove the syringe adapter from the bottle once inserted .
With the plunger fully depressed , insert one of the dosing syringes into the opening in the adapter .
Withdraw the exact amount of Rapamune oral solution as prescribed by your doctor by gently pulling out the plunger of the dosing syringe until the bottom of the black line of the plunger is level with the appropriate mark on the dosing syringe .
The bottle should remain in an upright position when withdrawing the solution .
If bubbles form in the dosing syringe during withdrawal , empty the Rapamune solution back into the bottle and repeat the withdrawal procedure .
69 4 .
You may have been instructed to take your Rapamune oral solution at a particular time of day .
If it is necessary to carry your medication with you , fill the dosing syringe to the appropriate mark and place a cap securely on it - the cap should snap into place .
Then place the capped dosing syringe in the carrying case provided .
Once in the syringe the medication may be kept at room temperature ( not exceeding 25 C ) or refrigerated and should be used within 24 hours .
Empty the contents of the dosing syringe into only a glass or plastic container holding at least 60 ml of water or orange juice .
Stir well for one minute and drink immediately .
Refill the glass with at least 120 ml of water or orange juice , stir well , and drink immediately .
No other liquids , including grapefruit juice , should be used for dilution .
The dosing syringe and cap are to be used once and then discarded .
When refrigerated the solution in the bottle may develop a slight haze .
If this occurs , simply bring your Rapamune 1 mg / 1 ml oral solution to room temperature and shake gently .
The presence of this haze does not affect the quality of Rapamune .
If you take more Rapamune than you should If you have taken more medicine than you were told contact a doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency department straight away .
Always take the labelled medicine bottle with you , even if it is empty .
If you forget to take Rapamune If you forget to take Rapamune , take it as soon as you remember , but not within 4 hours of the next dose of ciclosporin .
After that , continue to take your medicines as usual .
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , and always take Rapamune and ciclosporin approximately 4 hours apart .
If you miss a dose of Rapamune completely , you should inform your doctor .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines , Rapamune can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
However , since Rapamune is taken in combination with other medicines , the side effects cannot always be attributed with absolute certainty to Rapamune .
When taken with medicines called calcineurin inhibitors ( ciclosporin or tacrolimus ) , Rapamune may increase the risk of kidney damage with low blood platelets and low red blood cell counts with or without rash ( thrombocytopenic purpura / haemolytic uraemic syndrome ) .
Immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , reduce your body &quot; s own defence mechanisms to stop you rejecting your transplanted organ .
Consequently your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections .
So if you are taking Rapamune you may therefore catch more infections than usual such as infections of the skin , mouth , stomach and intestines , lungs and urinary tract .
70 Possible side effects of Rapamune are listed according to the following categories :
Very common : more than 1 per 10 Common : less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 Uncommon : less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 Rare : less than 1 per 1000

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
Manic episode :
The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
For patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
If a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-20 mg / day .
An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after
2 appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
ZYPREXA VELOTAB Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva , so it can be easily swallowed .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
A greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
Dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
In cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , ZYPREXA coated tablets should be used .
( See sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
3 Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6- 12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
4 Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , alanine transferase ( ALT ) , aspartate transferase ( AST ) have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease .
Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
5 Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Phenylalanine ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains aspartame , which is a source of phenylalanine .
May be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Mannitol ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains mannitol .
Sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate Olanzapine orodispersible tablet contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate . These preservatives are known to cause urticaria .
Generally , delayed type reactions such as contact dermatitis may occur , but rarely immediate reactions with bronchospasm may occur .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
6 Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults The most frequently ( seen in 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects ,
7 transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Increased alkaine phosphatase
Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
Weight gain 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
9 7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short- term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Very common ( 10 % ) , common ( 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
10 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .

9 Weight gain 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained 15 % and almost a third gained 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
Induction of emesis is not recommended .
Standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 % .
Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5HT2A / 2C , 5HT3 , 5HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α 1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
In addition , a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence .
Olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone , olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence ( olanzapine 30.0 % , lithium 38.3 % ; p = 0.055 ) .
12 In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser ( lithium or valproate ) , long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence , defined according to syndromic ( diagnostic ) criteria .
Paediatric population The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
The absorption is not affected by food .
Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
After oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
However , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
However , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or
13 smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α 1-acid-glycoprotein .
Paediatric population Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) :
The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
In clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 % higher in adolescents .
Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity :
Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; area under the curve &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
Reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Estrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

4.3 Contraindications
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .

Further information
WHAT ZYPREXA VELOTAB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ZYPREXA VELOTAB belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics .
ZYPREXA VELOTAB is used to treat a disease with symptoms such as hearing , seeing or sensing things which are not there , mistaken beliefs , unusual suspiciousness , and becoming withdrawn .
People with this disease may also feel depressed , anxious or tense .
ZYPREXA VELOTAB is used to treat a condition with symptoms such as feeling &quot; high , &quot; having excessive amounts of energy , needing much less sleep than usual , talking very quickly with racing ideas and sometimes severe irritability .
It is also a mood stabiliser that prevents further occurrences of the disabling high and low ( depressed ) extremes of mood associated with this condition .
BEFORE YOU TAKE ZYPREXA VELOTAB
Do not take ZYPREXA VELOTAB • If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients of ZYPREXA VELOTAB .
An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash , itching , a swollen face , swollen lips or shortness of breath .
If this has happened to you , tell your doctor . • If you have been previously diagnosed with eye problems such as certain kinds of glaucoma ( increased pressure in the eye ) .
Take special care with ZYPREXA VELOTAB • Medicines of this type may cause unusual movements mainly of the face or tongue .
If this happens after you have been given ZYPREXA VELOTAB tell your doctor . • Very rarely , medicines of this type cause a combination of fever , faster breathing , sweating , muscle stiffness and drowsiness or sleepiness .
If this happens , contact your doctor at once .
75 • The use of ZYPREXA VELOTAB in elderly patients with dementia is not recommended as it may have serious side effects .
If you suffer from any of the following illnesses tell your doctor as soon as possible :
• Diabetes • Heart disease • Liver or kidney disease • Parkinson &quot; s disease • Epilepsy • Prostate problems • A blocked intestine ( Paralytic ileus ) • Blood disorders • Stroke or &quot; mini &quot; stroke ( temporary symptoms of stroke )
If you suffer from dementia , you or your carer / relative should tell your doctor if you have ever had a stroke or &quot; mini &quot; stroke .
As a routine precaution , if you are over 65 years your blood pressure may be monitored by your doctor .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Myfenax is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal , cardiac or hepatic transplants .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Myfenax should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists .
Use in renal transplant :
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation .
The recommended dose in renal transplant patients is 1.0 g administered twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
Children and adolescents : the recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg / m2 administered orally twice daily ( up to a maximum of 2 g daily ) .
Myfenax capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area of at least 1.25 m2 .
Patients with a body surface are of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Myfenax capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily ( 1.5 g daily dose ) .
Patients with a body surface area greater than 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Myfenax capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group ( see section 4.8 ) compared with adults , temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required ; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction .
Children ( &lt; 2 years ) : there are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years .
These are insufficient to make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended .
Use in cardiac transplant :
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation .
The recommended dose in cardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily ( 3 g daily dose ) .
2 Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Use in hepatic transplant :
Adults : intravenous mycophenolate should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant , with oral Myfenax initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated .
The recommended oral dose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily ( 3 g daily dose ) .
Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Use in elderly ( ≥ 65 years )
The recommended dose of 1.0 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a day for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly .
Use in renal impairment
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 25 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ) , outside the immediate post-transplant period , doses greater than 1 g administered twice a day should be avoided .
These patients should also be carefully observed .
No dose adjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively ( see section 5.2 ) .
No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment .
Use in severe hepatic impairment
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease .
No data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease .
Treatment during rejection episodes
Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil .
Renal transplant rejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics ; dosage reduction or interruption of Myfenax is not required .
There is no basis for Myfenax dose adjustment following cardiac transplant rejection .
No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance , to mycophenolic acid or any of the excipients ..
Myfenax is contraindicated in women who are breast-feeding ( see section 4.6 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including Myfenax , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.8 ) .
The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent .
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and ultra violet ( UV ) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Patients receiving Myfenax should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection , unexpected bruising , bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression .
3 Patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Myfenax , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) , fatal infections and sepsis ( see section 4.8 ) .
Among the opportunistic infections are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms .
Patients receiving Myfenax should be monitored for neutropenia , which may be related to Myfenax itself , concomitant medicinal products , viral infections , or some combination of these causes .
Patients taking Myfenax should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month , twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment then monthly through the first year .
If neutropenia develops ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.3 x 103 / μ l ) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue Myfenax .
Patients should be advised that during treatment with Myfenax , vaccinations may be less effective and the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
Influenza vaccination may be of value .
Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination .
Because mycophenolate has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events , including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration , haemorrhage and perforation , Myfenax should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease .
Myfenax is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) inhibitor .
On theoretical grounds , therefore , it should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HGPRT ) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome .
It is recommended that Myfenax should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such concomitant administration has not been studied .
In view of the significant reduction in the AUC ( area under the curve ) of MPA by cholestyramine , caution should be used in the concomitant administration of Myfenax with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfenax .
The risk-benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with tacrolimus or sirolimus has not been established ( see also section 4.5 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Aciclovir : higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone .
The changes in MPAG ( the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ) pharmacokinetics ( MPAG increased by 8 % ) were minimal and are not considered clinically significant .
Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment , as are aciclovir concentrations , the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir , or its prodrugs , e. g. valaciclovir , to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations of both substances may occur .
Antacids with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides : absorption of mycophenolate mofetil was decreased when administered with antacids .
Cholestyramine : following single dose administration 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-treated with 4 g three times a day ( TID ) of cholestyramine for 4 days , there was a 40 % reduction in the AUC of MPA ( see section 4.4 and section 5.2 ) .
Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the potential to reduce efficacy of Myfenax .
4 Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic circulation : caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic circulation because of their potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfenax .
Ciclosporin A : ciclosporin A ( CsA ) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil .
In contrast , if concomitant ciclosporin treatment is stopped , an increase in MPA AUC of around 30 % should be expected .
Ganciclovir ; based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate ( see section 4.2 ) and ganciclovir , it is anticipated that co- administration of these agents ( which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion ) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration .
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and mycophenolate mofetil dose adjustment is not required .
In patients with renal impairment in which Myfenax and ganciclovir or its prodrugs , e. g. valganciclovir , are co-administered the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients monitored carefully .
Oral contraceptives : the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-administration of mycophenolate ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Rifampicin : in patients not also taking ciclosporin , concomitant administration of Mycophenolate mofetil and rifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure ( AUC0-12h ) of 18 % to 70 % .
It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myfenax doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is administered concomitantly .
Sirolimus : in renal transplant patients , concomitant administration of mycphenolate mofetil and CsA resulted in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50 % compared with patients receiving the combination of sirolimus and similar doses of Myfenax ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Sevelamer : decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC by 30 % and 25 % , respectively , were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences ( i. e. graft rejection ) .
It is recommended , however , to administer Myfenax at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA .
There is no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole : no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed .
Norfloxacin and metronidazole : in healthy volunteers , no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin and metronidazole separately .
However , norfloxacin and metronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30 % following a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil .
Tacrolimus : in liver transplant recipients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus , the AUC and Cmax of MPA , the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil , were not significantly affected by trough tacrolimus level .
In renal transplant patients , the tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil .
However , in hepatic transplant patients , there was an increase of approximately 20 % in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil ( 1.5 g taken twice &#91; BID &#93; a day , morning and evening &#93; ) were administered to patients taking tacrolimus ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Other interactions : co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG by 3-fold .
Thus , other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion .
5 Live vaccines : live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished ( see also section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
It is recommended that Myfenax therapy should not be initiated until a negative pregnancy test has been obtained .
Effective contraception must be used before beginning Myfenax therapy , during therapy , and for six weeks following discontinuation of therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
Patients should be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur .
The use of Myfenax is not recommended during pregnancy and should be reserved for cases where no more suitable alternative treatment is available .
Myfenax should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
There is limited data from the use of mycophenolate mofetil in pregnant women .
However , congenital malformations including ear malformations , i. e. abnormally formed or absent external / middle ear have been reported in children of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy .
Cases of spontaneous abortions have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether this substance is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants , Myfenax is contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
The pharmacodynamics profile and the reported adverse reactions indicate that an effect is unlikely .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects cover adverse reactions from clinical trials :
The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids include diarrhoea , leucopenia , sepsis and vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
Malignancies :
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including mycophenolate , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.4 ) .
Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.6 % of patients receiving mycophenolate ( 2 g or 3 g daily ) in combination with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year .
Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 3.6 % of patients ; other types of malignancy occurred in 1.1 % of patients .
Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data .
Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year , but less than 3 years .
Opportunistic infections :
All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections ; the risk increased with total immunosuppressive load ( see section 4.4 ) .
The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate ( 2 g or 3 g daily ) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) viraemia / syndrome and Herpes simplex .
The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia / syndrome was 13.5 % .
6 Children and adolescents :
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study , which recruited 92 paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years who where given 600 mg / m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily , were generally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate twice daily .
However , the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population , particularly in children under 6 years of age , when compared to adults : diarrhoea , sepsis , leucopenia , anaemia and infection .
Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) :
Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to immunosuppression .
Elderly patients receiving Myfenax as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen , may be at increased risk of certain infections ( including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease ) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema , compared to younger individuals .
Other adverse reactions :
Adverse reactions , probably or possibly related to mycophenolate , reported in ≥ 1 / 10 and in ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 of patients treated with mycophenolate in the controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are listed in the following table .
Within the system organ classes , undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency , using the following categories : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) . Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

Note :
501 ( 2 g mycophenolate daily ) , 289 ( 3 g mycophenolate daily ) and 277 ( 2 g intravenous / 3 g oral mycophenolate daily ) patients were treated in Phase III studies for the prevention of rejection in renal , cardiac and hepatic transplantation , respectively .
The following undesirable effects cover adverse reactions from post-marketing experience : the types of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing with mycophenolate are similar to those seen in the controlled renal , cardiac and hepatic transplant studies .
Additional adverse reactions reported during post-marketing are described below with the frequencies reported within brackets if known .
Gastrointestinal : colitis including cytomegalovirus colitis , ( common ) , pancreatitis , ( common ) and intestinal villous atrophy .
Disorders related to immunosuppression : serious life-threatening infections including meningitis , endocarditis , tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection .
Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy , as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy ( PML ) , have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Myfenax .
Agranulocytosis ( uncommon ) and neutropenia have been reported ; therefore regular monitoring of
9 patients taking Myfenax is advised ( see section 4.4 ) .
Hypersensitivity : hypersensitivity reactions , including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported .
Congenital disorders : see further details in section 4.6 . 4.9 Overdose Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-marketing experience . In many of these cases , no adverse events were reported .
In those overdose cases in which adverse events were reported , the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal product .
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression ( see section 4.4 ) .
If neutropenia develops , dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced ( see section 4.4 ) .
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG .
Bile acid sequestrants , such as cholestyramine , can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic re- circulation of the drug ( see section 5.2 ) .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : immunosuppressive agents ATC code :
LO4A A06
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) .
MPA is a potent , selective , uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase , and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA .
Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways , MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following oral administration , mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite , MPA .
As evidenced by suppression of acute rejection following renal transplantation , the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate is correlated with MPA concentration .
The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil , based on MPA AUC , is 94 % relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil .
Food had no effect on the extent of absorption ( MPA AUC ) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients .
However , MPA Cmax was decreased by 40 % in the presence of food .
Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration .
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations , is 97 % bound to plasma albumin .
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation , secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually observed at approximately 6 - 12 hours post-dose .
A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40 % is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine ( 4 g TID ) , indicating that there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation .
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ( MPAG ) , which is not pharmacologically active .
10 A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA ( &lt; 1 % of dose ) in the urine .
Orally administered radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose ; with 93 % of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the faeces .
Most ( about 87 % ) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG .
At clinically encountered concentrations , MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis .
However , at high MPAG plasma concentrations ( &gt; 100μ g / ml ) , small amounts of MPAG are removed .
In the early post-transplant period ( &lt; 40 days post-transplant ) , renal , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30 % lower and Cmax approximately 40 % lower compared to the late post-transplant period ( 3 - 6 months post-transplant ) .
Renal impairment :
In a single dose study ( 6 subjects / group ) , mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe chronic renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 25 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ) were 28-75 % higher relative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment .
However , the mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects , consistent with the known renal elimination of MPAG .
Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal impairment has not been studied .
No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment .
Delayed renal graft function :
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant , mean MPA AUC ( 0-12h ) was comparable to that seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function .
Mean plasma MPAG AUC ( 0- 12h ) was 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function .
There may be a transient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft function .
Dose adjustment of Myfenax does not appear to be necessary .
Hepatic impairment :
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis , hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease .
Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend on the particular disease .
However , hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage , such as primary biliary cirrhosis , may show a different effect .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients given 600 mg / m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily .
This dose achieved MPA AUC values similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate at a dose of 1 g BID in the early and late post-transplant period .
MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early and late post- transplant period .
Pharmacokinetic behaviour of mycophenolate in the elderly has not been formally evaluated .
Oral contraceptives :
The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co administration of mycophenolate ( see also section 4.5 ) .
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate ( 1 g BID ) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol ( 0.02 mg to 0.04 mg ) and levonorgestrel ( 0.05 mg to 0.15 mg ) , desogestrel ( 0.15 mg ) or gestodene ( 0.05 mg to 0.10 mg ) conducted in 18 non-transplant women ( not taking other immunosuppressants ) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives .
Serum levels of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and progesterone were not significantly affected .
11 5.3 Preclinical safety data
In experimental models , mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic .
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day and 1.3-2 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day .
Two genotoxicity assays ( in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test ) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations .
These effects can be related to the pharmacodynamics mode of action , i. e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells .
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity .
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg kg-1 day-1 .
The systemic exposure at this dose represents 2-3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day in renal transplant patients and 1.3-2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day in cardiac transplant patients .
In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats , oral doses of 4.5 mg kg-1 day-1 caused malformations ( including anophthalmia , agnathia and hydrocephaly ) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .
No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation .
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits , foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 6 mg kg-1 day-1 ( including anophthalmia , agnathia , and hydrocephaly ) and in rabbits at 90 mg kg-1 day-1 ( including cardiovascular and renal anomalies , such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys , and diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia ) , in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The systemic exposure at these levels are approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .
Refer to section 4.6 .
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat , mouse , dog and monkey .
These effects occurred at systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant recipients .
Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended doses .
Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose ( systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure ) .
The nonclinical toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population ( see section 4.8 ) .

Myfenax 500 mg film-coated tablets
Each tablet contains 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1
Film-coated tablet ( tablet ) Pale purple , oval shaped film-coated tablet , debossed with &quot; M500 &quot; on one side and plain on the other side .
Myfenax tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area greater than 1.5 m2 , at a dose of 1 g twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group ( see section 4.8 ) compared with adults , temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required ; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction .
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation .
Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including Myfenax , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.8 ) .
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and ultra-violet ( UV ) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The changes in MPAG ( the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ) pharmacokinetics ( MPAG increased by 8 % ) were minimal and are not considered clinically significant .
Sevelamer : decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12 by 30 % and 25 % , respectively , were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences ( i. e. graft rejection ) .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole : no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed .
Live vaccines : live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response .
The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Myfenax should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions , probably or possibly related to mycophenolate , reported in ≥ 1 / 10 and in ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 of patients treated with mycophenolate in the controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are listed in the following table .
Within the system organ classes , undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency , using the following categories : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .

Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Agranulocytosis ( uncommon ) and neutropenia have been reported ; therefore regular monitoring of patients taking Myfenax is advised ( see section 4.4 ) . There have been reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow depression in patients treated with mycophenolate , some of which have been fatal .
Hypersensitivity : hypersensitivity reactions , including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported .
22 Congenital disorders : see further details in section 4.6 .
4.9 Overdose
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression ( see section 4.4 ) . If neutropenia develops , dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced ( see section 4.4 ) .
Orally administered radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose ; with 93 %
23 of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the faeces .
Most ( about 87 % ) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG .
In the early post-transplant period ( &lt; 40 days post-transplant ) , renal , cardiac and hepatic transplants patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30 % lower and Cmax approximately 40 % lower compared to the late post-transplant period ( 3 - 6 months post-transplant ) .
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate ( 1 g BID ) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol ( 0.02 mg to 0.04 mg ) and levonorgestrel ( 0.05 mg to 0.15 mg ) , desogestrel ( 0.15 mg ) or gestodene ( 0.05 mg to 0.10 mg ) conducted in 18 non-transplant women ( not taking other immunosuppressants ) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives .
24 In experimental models , mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic .
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 - 3 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day and 1.3 - 2 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day .
Two genotoxicity assays ( in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test ) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations .
The systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 - 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 - 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day in cardiac transplant patients .
The systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .

Further information
WHAT MYFENAX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Myfenax is a medicine that is used to suppress immune activity .
Myfenax is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted kidney , heart or liver .
It is used in combination with other medicines with a similar function ( i. e. ciclosporin and corticosteroids ) .
BEFORE YOU TAKE MYFENAX
Do not take Myfenax
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to mycophenolate mofetil , mycophenolic acid or any of the
other ingredients of Myfenax .
- if you are breast-feeding .
Take special care with Myfenax You should inform your doctor immediately :
- if you experience any evidence of infection ( e. g. fever , sore throat ) , unexpected bruising and / or
bleeding
- if you have or ever have had any problems with your digestive system , e. g. stomach ulcers
Myfenax reduces your body &quot; s defence mechanism .
Because of this , there is an increased risk of skin cancer .
Therefore you should limit your exposure to sunlight and ultra violet ( UV ) light by wearing appropriate protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Taking other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
If you answer yes to any of the following questions talk to your doctor before you start to take Myfenax :
- Are you taking any medicines containing : azathioprine or other immunosuppressive agents ( which
are sometimes given to patients after a transplant operation ) , cholestyramine ( used to treat patients 39 with high blood cholesterol ) , rifampicin ( antibiotic ) , antacids , phosphate binders ( used in patients with chronic renal kidney failure to reduce the absorption of phosphate ) or any other medicines ( including those you can buy without a prescription ) that your doctor does not know about ?
- Do you need to receive vaccines ( live vaccines ) ?
Your doctor will have to advise you what is
indicated for you
Taking Myfenax with food and drink Taking food and drink has no influence on your treatment with Myfenax .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Do not take Myfenax if you are breast feeding .
Your doctor should advise you about using contraception before taking Myfenax , whilst taking Myfenax , and for 6 weeks after you have stopped taking Myfenax .
Myfenax may cause spontaneous abortions or damage , including problems with development of the ears , to your unborn baby .
Tell your doctor straight away if you are pregnant , breast-feeding , become pregnant or plan to start a family in the near future .

The recommended daily dose is 12 capsules ( 3 g of the active ingredient ) taken as 2 separate doses . This means taking 6 capsules in the morning then 6 capsules in the evening .
No data are available to recommend the use of Myfenax in children and adolescents who have received a heart transplant .
Liver Transplant
The first dose of oral Myfenax will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant operation and when you are able to swallow oral medicines . The recommended daily dose is 12 capsules ( 3 g of the
40 active ingredient ) taken as 2 separate doses . This means taking 6 capsules in the morning then 6 capsules in the evening .
No data are available to recommend the use of Myfenax in children and adolescents who have received a liver transplant .
Method and route of administration Swallow your capsules whole with a glass of water .
Do not break or crush them and do not take any capsules that have broken open or split .
Avoid contact with any powder that spills out from damaged capsules .
If a capsule breaks open accidentally , wash any powder from your skin with soap and water .
If any powder gets into your eyes or mouth , rinse thoroughly with plenty of plain , fresh water .
Treatment will continue for you as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent your body from rejecting your transplanted organ .
If you take more Myfenax than you should It is important not to take too many capsules .
Contact your nearest hospital Accident and Emergency department or a doctor for advice if you have swallowed more capsules than you have been told to take or if you think a child has swallowed any .
If you forget to take Myfenax If you forget to take your medicine at any time , take it as soon as you remember , then continue to take it at the usual times .
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
If you stop taking Myfenax Do not stop taking Myfenax because you feel better .
It is important to take the medicine for as long as the doctor has told you to .
Stopping your treatment with Myfenax may increase the chance of rejection of your transplanted organ .
Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Maintenance treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
FOR INTRAMUSCULAR USE ONLY .
DO NOT ADMINISTER INTRAVENOUSLY OR SUBCUTANEOUSLY .
( See section 4.4 )
ZYPADHERA should only be administered by deep intramuscular gluteal injection by a healthcare professional trained in the appropriate injection technique and in locations where postinjection observation and access to appropriate medical care in the case of overdose can be assured .
After each injection , patients should be observed in a health care facility by appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours for signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose .
It should be confirmed that the patient is alert , oriented , and absent of any signs and symptoms of overdose .
If an overdose is suspected , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until examination indicates that signs and symptoms have resolved ( See section 4.4 . ) .
Patients should be treated initially with oral olanzapine before administering ZYPADHERA , to establish tolerability and response .
For Instructions for Use , see section 6.6 .
Do not confuse ZYPADHERA 210 mg powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection with olanzapine 10 mg powder for solution for injection .
In order to identify the first ZYPADHERA dose for all patients the scheme in Table 1 should be considered .
2 Table 1
Recommended dose scheme between oral olanzapine and ZYPADHERA
Target Oral Dose 10 mg / day 15 mg / day 20 mg / day
Olanzapine Recommended Starting Dose of Maintenance Dose after 2 Months of ZYPADHERA ZYPADHERA Treatment 210 mg / 2 weeks or 405 mg / 4 weeks 150 mg / 2 weeks or 300 mg / 4 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks 210 mg / 2 weeks or 405 mg / 4 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks
Dose Adjustment Patients should be monitored carefully for signs of relapse during the first one to two months of treatment .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &quot; s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
During treatment dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status .
After clinical reassessment dosage may be adjusted within the range 150 mg to 300 mg every 2 weeks or 300 to 405 mg every 4 weeks .
( Table 1 )
Supplementation Supplementation with oral olanzapine was not authorised in double-blind clinical studies .
If oral olanzapine supplementation is clinically indicated , then the combined total dose of olanzapine from both formulations should not exceed the corresponding maximum oral olanzapine dose of 20 mg / day .
Switching to other antipsychotic medicinal products There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from ZYPADHERA to other antipsychotic medicinal products .
Due to the slow dissolution of the olanzapine pamoate salt which provides a slow continuous release of olanzapine that is complete approximately six to eight months after the last injection , supervision by a clinician , especially during the first 2 months after discontinuation of ZYPADHERA , is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product and is considered medically appropriate .
Elderly patients ZYPADHERA has not been systematically studied in elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years ) .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended for treatment in the elderly population unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established .
A lower starting dose ( 150 mg / 4 weeks ) is not routinely indicated , but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended to be started in patients &gt; 75 years ( see section 4.4 ) .
Patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment Unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established in such patients , ZYPADHERA should not be used .
A lower starting dose ( 150 mg every 4 weeks ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child- Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 150 mg every 4 weeks and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the dose .
When indicated , dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients .
3 ZYPADHERA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Special care must be taken to apply appropriate injection technique to avoid inadvertent intravascular or subcutaneous injection ( see section 6.6 ) .
Use in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state ZYPADHERA should not be used to treat patients with schizophrenia who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state such that immediate symptom control is warranted .
Post-injection syndrome During pre-marketing clinical studies , events that presented with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose , were reported in patients following an injection of ZYPADHERA .
These events occurred in &lt; 0.1 % of injections and approximately 1.4 % of patients . Most of these patients have developed symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
Other symptoms noted include extrapyramidal symptoms , dysarthria , ataxia , aggression , dizziness , weakness , hypertension and convulsion .
In most cases , initial signs and symptoms related to this event have appeared within 1 hour following injection , and in all cases full recovery was reported to have occurred within 24 - 72 hours after injection .
Events occurred rarely ( &lt; 1 in 1,000 injections ) between 1 and 3 hours , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 in 10,000 injections ) after 3 hours .
Patients should be advised about this potential risk and the need to be observed for 3 hours in a healthcare facility each time ZYPADHERA is administered .
Prior to giving the injection , the healthcare professional should determine that the patient will not travel alone to their destination .
After each injection , patients should be observed in a healthcare facility by appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours for signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose .
It should be confirmed that the patient is alert , oriented , and absent of any signs and symptoms of overdose .
If an overdose is suspected , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until examination indicates that signs and symptoms have resolved .
For the remainder of the day after injection , patients should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of overdose secondary to post injection adverse reactions , be able to obtain assistance if needed and should not drive or operate machinery ( see section 4.7 ) .
If parenteral benzodiazepines are essential for management of post injection adverse reactions , careful evaluation of clinical status for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression is recommended .
( see section 4.5 )
Injection Site Related Adverse Events The most commonly reported injection site related adverse event was pain .
The majority of these events was reported to be of &quot; mild &quot; to &quot; moderate &quot; severity .
In the event of an injection site related adverse event occuring , appropriate measures to manage these events should be taken .
( see section 4.8 )
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase
4 in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident . In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6-12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in oral olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in oral olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with oral olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All oral olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and oral olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Oral olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with oral olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ZYPADHERA , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia , and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight should be monitored regularly .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ZYPADHERA , should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines .
5 Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease .
Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when oral olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral olanzapine , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
In clinical trials with olanzapine powder for solution for injection or ZYPADHERA , olanzapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT or in QTc intervals .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
6 Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Use in elderly patients ( &gt; 75 years ) No information on the use of ZYPADHERA in patients &gt; 75 years is available .
Due to biochemical and physiological modification and reduction of muscular mass , this formulation is not recommended to be started in this sub-group of patients .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Caution should be exercised in patients who receive medicinal products that can induce hypotension or sedation .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing
7 mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study of oral olanzapine in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
As olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day after each injection due to the possibility of a post-injection syndrome event leading to symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Post-injection syndrome events have occurred with ZYPADHERA leading to symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
Clinical signs and symptoms included symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
Other adverse reactions observed in patients treated with ZYPADHERA were similar to those seen with oral olanzapine .
In clinical trials with ZYPADHERA , the only adverse reaction reported at a statistically significantly higher rate in the ZYPADHERA group than in the placebo group was
8 sedation ( ZYPADHERA 8.2 % , placebo 2.0 % ) . Among all ZYPADHERA treated patients , sedation was reported by 4.7 % of patients .
In clinical trials with ZYPADHERA the incidence of injection site related adverse events was approximately 8 % .
The most commonly reported injection site related adverse event was pain ( 5 % ) ; some other injection site adverse events reported were ( in decreasing frequency ) : nodule type reactions , erythema type reactions , non-specific injection site reactions , irritation , oedema type reactions , bruising , haemorrhage , and anesthesia .
These events occurred in about 0.1 to 1.1 % of patients .
The undesirable effects listed below have been observed following administration of oral olanzapine but may occur following administration of ZYPADHERA .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
The following table lists the adverse reactions and laboratory investigations observed from spontaneous reporting and in clinical trials .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) , uncommon ( ≥ 0.1 % and &lt; 1 % ) , rare ( ≥ 0.01 % and &lt; 0.1 % ) , very rare ( &lt; 0.01 % ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the data available ) .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
10 4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( ≥ 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures . The
11 magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
Common :
Elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
Sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
Gastrointestinal disorders Common :
Dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
Elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
Decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained ≥ 15 % and almost a third gained ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
If signs and symptoms of overdose consistent with post injection syndrome are observed , appropriate supportive measures should be taken ( see section 4.4 ) .
While overdose is less likely with parenteral than oral medication , reference information for oral olanzapine overdose is presented below :
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute oral overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
12 and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : diazepines , oxazepines and thiazepines , ATC code N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5-HT2A / 2C , 5-HT3 , 5-HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α -1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5-HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
The effectiveness of ZYPADHERA in the treatment and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia is consistent with the established effectiveness of the oral formulation of olanzapine .
In a Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) study in patients treated with ZYPADHERA ( 300 mg / 4 weeks ) , mean D2 receptor occupancy was 60 % or higher at the end of a 6 month period , a level consistent with that found during treatment with oral olanzapine .
A total of 1469 patients with schizophrenia were included in 2 pivotal trials :
The first , an 8-week , placebo controlled trial conducted in adult patients ( n = 404 ) who were experiencing acute psychotic symptoms .
Patients were randomized to receive injections of ZYPADHERA 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , 210 mg every 2 weeks , or placebo every 2 weeks .
No oral antipsychotic supplementation was allowed .
Total Positive and Negative Symptom Scores ( PANSS ) showed significant improvement from baseline ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 101 ) to endpoint ( mean changes -22.57 , -26.32 , -22.49 respectively ) with each dose of ZYPADHERA ( 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , and 210 mg every 2 weeks ) as compared to placebo ( mean change -8.51 ) .
Visitwise mean change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS Total score indicated that by Day 3 , patients in the 300 mg / 2 weeks and 405 mg / 4 weeks treatment groups had statistically significantly greater reductions in PANSS Total score compared to placebo ( -8.6 , -8.2 , and -5.2 , respectively ) .
All 3 ZYPADHERA treatment groups showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo beginning by end of Week 1 .
These results support efficacy for ZYPADHERA over 8 weeks of treatment and a drug effect that was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with ZYPADHERA .
The second , a long term study in clinically stable patients ( n = 1065 ) ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 54.33 to 57.75 ) who were initially treated with oral olanzapine for 4 to 8 weeks and then switched to continue on oral olanzapine or to ZYPADHERA for 24 weeks .
No oral antipsychotic supplementation was allowed .
ZYPADHERA treatment groups of 150 mg and 300 mg given every 2 weeks ( doses pooled for analysis ) and 405 mg given every 4 weeks were non inferior to the combined doses of 10 , 15 and 20 mg of oral olanzapine ( doses pooled for analysis ) as measured by rates of
13 exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia ( respective exacerbation rates , 10 % , 10 % 7 % ) . Exacerbation was measured by worsening of items on the PANSS derived BPRS Positive scale and hospitalization due to worsening of positive psychotic symptoms .
The combined 150 mg and 300 mg / 2 week treatment group was non inferior to the 405 mg / 4 week treatment group ( exacerbation rates 10 % for each group ) at 24 weeks after randomisation .
Paediatric population ZYPADHERA has not been studied in the paediatric population .
The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term oral olanzapine efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Oral olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with oral olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine is metabolised in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide .
Cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites ; both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent , olanzapine .
After a single IM injection with ZYPADHERA the slow dissolution of the olanzapine pamoate salt in muscle tissue begins immediately and provides a slow continuous release of olanzapine for more than four weeks .
The release becomes diminishingly smaller within eight to twelve weeks .
Antipsychotic supplementation is not required at the initiation of ZYPADHERA treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
The combination of the release profile and the dosage regimen ( IM injection every two or four weeks ) result in sustained olanzapine plasma concentrations .
Plasma concentrations remain measurable for several months after each ZYPADHERA injection .
The half-life of olanzapine after ZYPADHERA is 30 days compared to 30 hours following oral administration .
The absorption and elimination are complete approximately six to eight months after the last injection .
Oral olanzapine is rapidly distributed .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine is about 93 % over the concentration range of 7 to about 1000 ng / mL .
In plasma , olanzapine is bound to albumin and α 1-acid glycoprotein .
Olanzapine plasma clearance after oral olanzapine is lower in females ( 18.9 l / hr ) versus males ( 27.3 l / hr ) , and in non-smokers ( 18.6 l / hr ) versus smokers ( 27.7 l / hr ) .
Similar pharmacokinetic differences between males and females and smokers and nonsmokers were observed in ZYPADHERA clinical trials .
However , the magnitude of the impact of gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
After repeated IM injections with 150 to 300 mg ZYPADHERA every two weeks , the 10th to 90th percentile of steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine were between 4.2 and 73.2 ng / ml .
The plasma concentrations of olanzapine observed across the dose range of 150mg every 4 weeks to 300mg every 2 weeks illustrate increased systemic olanzapine exposure with increased ZYPADHERA doses .
During the initial three months of treatment with ZYPADHERA , accumulation of olanzapine was observed but there was no additional accumulation during long-term use ( 12 months ) in patients who were injected with up to 300 mg every two weeks .
No specific investigations have been conducted in the elderly with ZYPADHERA .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended for treatment in the elderly population ( 65 years and over ) unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus
14 33.8 hours ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) . The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hours ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
Although patients with renal impairment were not studied with ZYPADHERA , it is recommended that a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine is established in patients with renal impairment before treatment with ZYPADHERA is initiated ( see section 4.2 ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hours ) of orally administered olanzapine was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non- smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hours and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
Although patients with hepatic impairment were not studied with ZYPADHERA , it is recommended that a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine is established in patients with hepatic impairment before treatment with ZYPADHERA is initiated ( see section 4.2 ) .
In a study of oral olanzapine given to Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical safety studies were performed using olanzapine pamoate monohydrate .
The main findings found in repeat-dose toxicity studies ( rat , dog ) , in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study , and in toxicity to reproduction studies ( rat , rabbit ) were limited to injection site reactions for which no NOAEL could be determined .
No new toxic effect resulting from systemic exposure to olanzapine could be identified .
However , systemic concentrations in these studies were generally less than that seen at effect levels in the oral studies ; thus the information on oral olanzapine is provided below for reference .
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent antipsychotic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , laboured respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity :
Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12 mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no undesirable effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
15 Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Oestrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in foetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and oral in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of oral studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

20 Table 1
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the dose .
These events occurred in &lt; 0.1 % of injections and approximately 1.4 % of patients . Most of these patients have developed symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
If parenteral benzodiazepines are essential for management of post injection adverse reactions , careful evaluation of clinical status for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression is recommended .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral olanzapine , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
Due to biochemical and physiological modification and reduction of muscular mass , this formulation is not recommended to be started in this sub-group of patients .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
28 4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Total Positive and Negative Symptom Scores ( PANSS ) showed significant improvement from baseline ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 101 ) to endpoint ( mean changes -22.57 , -26.32 , -22.49 respectively ) with each dose of ZYPADHERA ( 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , and 210 mg every 2 weeks ) as compared to placebo ( mean change -8.51 ) .
