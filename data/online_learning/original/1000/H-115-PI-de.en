CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
Manic episode :
The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
For patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
If a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
2 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
A greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
Dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( See sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6-12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
3 CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment . The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with
4 myeloproliferative disease . Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported ..
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Lactose ZYPREXA tablets contain lactose .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
5 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
6 olanzapine . Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed
across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories . Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
8 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
9 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( ≥ 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
Common :
Elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
Sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
Gastrointestinal disorders Common :
Dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
Elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
Decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained ≥ 15 % and almost a third gained ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
Induction of emesis is not recommended .
Standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 % .
10 Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5 HT2A / 2C , 5 HT3 , 5 HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α 1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence . Olanzapine also
11 showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone , olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence ( olanzapine 30.0 % , lithium 38.3 % ; p = 0.055 ) .
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser ( lithium or valproate ) , long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence , defined according to syndromic ( diagnostic ) criteria .
Paediatric population The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
The absorption is not affected by food .
Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
After oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
However , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
12 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
However , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α 1-acid-glycoprotein .
Paediatric population Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) :
The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
In clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 % higher in adolescents .
Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
Reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Estrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

ZYPREXA 10 mg powder for solution for injection
Each vial contains 10 mg olanzapine .
After reconstitution each ml of the solution contains 5 mg olanzapine .
Powder for solution for injection Yellow lyophilised powder .
Adults ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or manic episode , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
Treatment with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection should be discontinued and the use of oral olanzapine should be initiated as soon as clinically appropriate .
Adults For intramuscular use .
Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is intended for short term use only , for up to a maximum of three consecutive days .
The maximum daily dose of olanzapine ( including all formulations of olanzapine ) is 20 mg .
The recommended initial dose for olanzapine injection is 10 mg , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
A lower dose ( 5 mg or 7.5 mg ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
A second injection , 5-10 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection on the basis of individual clinical status .
Not more than three injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of olanzapine of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) should not be exceeded .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection should be reconstituted in accordance with the recommendation in section 6.6 .
For further information on continued treatment with oral olanzapine ( 5 to 20 mg daily ) , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ZYPREXA coated tablets or ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablets .
Children and adolescents There is no experience in children .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
86 Elderly The recommended starting dose in elderly patients ( &gt; 60 years ) is 2.5 - 5 mg .
Depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status ( see section 4.4 ) , a second injection , 2.5 - 5 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection .
Not more than 3 injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) of olanzapine should not be exceeded .
The efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been established in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours related to conditions other than schizophrenia or manic episode .
Unstable medical conditions IM olanzapine should not be administered to patients with unstable medical conditions , such as acute myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , severe hypotension and / or bradycardia , sick sinus syndrome , or following heart surgery .
If the patient &quot; s medical history with regard to these unstable medical conditions cannot be determined , the risks and benefits of IM olanzapine should be considered in relation to other alternative treatments .
Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other medicinal products Special caution is necessary in patients who have received treatment with other medicinal products having haemodynamic properties similar to those of intramuscular olanzapine including other antipsychotics ( oral and / or intramuscular ) and benzodiazepines ( see section 4.5 ) .
Temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory depression and death has been very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) reported particularly in patients who have received benzodiazepines and / or other antipsychotics ( see section 4.8 ) .
Simultaneous injection of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.5 and 6.2 ) .
If the patient is considered to need parenteral benzodiazepine treatment , this should not be given until at least one hour after IM olanzapine administration .
If the patient has received parenteral benzodiazepine , IM olanzapine administration should only be considered after careful evaluation of clinical status and the patient should be closely monitored for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
87 Hypotension It is extremely important that patients receiving intramuscular olanzapine should be closely observed for hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation , particularly for the first 4 hours following injection and close observation should be continued after this period if clinically indicated .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be observed regularly and remedial treatment provided if required .
Patients should remain recumbent if dizzy or drowsy after injection until examination indicates that they are not experiencing hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation .
The safety and efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit drugs ) ( see section 4.5 ) .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during oral clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral administration , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
In clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection , olanzapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT or in QTc intervals .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
89 General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator oral studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in oral olanzapine clinical trials .
IM olanzapine has not been studied in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( see section 4.4 ) .
Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can induce hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory or central nervous system depression ( see section 4.4 ) .
Potential for interaction following intramuscular injection In a single dose intramuscular study of olanzapine 5 mg , administered 1 hour before intramuscular lorazepam 2 mg ( metabolised by glucuronidation ) , the pharmacokinetics of both medicines were unchanged .
However , the combination added to the somnolence observed with either medicines alone .
Concomitant injection of olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 6.2 ) .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
90 Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists ( see section 6.2 ) .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
A common ( 1-10 % ) undesirable effect associated with the use of intramuscular olanzapine in clinical trials was somnolence .
In post marketing reports , temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with cases of respiratory depression , hypotension or bradycardia and death have been very rarely reported , mostly in patients who concomitantly received benzodiazepines , and / or other antipsychotic medicinal products or who were treated in excess of olanzapine recommended daily doses ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
91 The following table is based on the undesirable effects and laboratory investigations from clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection rather than oral olanzapine .
Cardiac disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Bradycardia with or without hypotension or syncope , tachycardia . Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Sinus pause . Vascular Disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Postural hypotension , hypotension . Respiratory disorders Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Hypoventilation . General disorders and administration site conditions Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Injection site discomfort .
The undesirable effects listed below have been observed following administration of oral olanzapine , but may also occur following administration of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
Tardive dyskinesia Discontinuation symptoms7 Cardiac disorders Vascular disorders
Bradycardia QTc prolongation ( see section 4.4 )
Ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation , sudden death ( see section 4.4 )
Gastrointestinal disorders
93 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
94 Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with oral olanzapine in over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary
95 analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring oral olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , oral olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Oral olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers , a dose of 5 mg of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection produced a maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) approximately 5 times higher than that seen with the same dose of olanzapine administered orally .
The Cmax occurs earlier after intramuscular compared to oral use ( 15 to 45 minutes versus 5 to 8 hours ) .
As with oral use , Cmax and area under the curve after intramuscular use are directly proportional to the dose administered .
For the same dose of olanzapine administered intramuscularly and orally , the associated area under the curve , half-life , clearance and volume of distribution are similar .
The metabolic profiles following intramuscular and oral use are similar .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) administered olanzapine intramuscularly the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
Additional pharmacokinetic data following administration of oral olanzapine are described below .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects administered oral olanzapine , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
96 In female versus male subjects administered oral olanzapine the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects administered oral olanzapine , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction administered olanzapine orally , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , laboured respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of oral studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .
