CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension ( as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye ( s ) once daily , administered in the evening .
The dose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect .
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used , each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart .
Use in children and adolescents ( under the age of 18 ) :
LUMIGAN has only been studied in adults and therefore its use is not recommended in children or adolescents .
Use in hepatic and renal impairment :
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients .
In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal ALT , AST and / or bilirubin at baseline , LUMIGAN had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 months .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
2 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Before treatment is initiated , patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth , darkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation since these have been observed during treatment with LUMIGAN .
Some of these changes may be permanent , and may lead to differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated .
The change in iris pigmentation occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for several months .
At 12 months , the incidence was 1.5 % and did not increase following 3 years treatment .
LUMIGAN contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride , which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses .
Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration .
Benzalkonium chloride , which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products , has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Since LUMIGAN contains benzalkonium chloride , monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients or where the cornea is compromised .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function and should therefore be used with caution in such patients .
In clinical studies , in those patients with a history of a compromised respiratory function , no significant untoward respiratory effects have been seen .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or uncontrolled congestive heart failure .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions , neovascular , inflammatory , angle-closure glaucoma , congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma .
Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) following treatment with LUMIGAN and should therefore be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema ( e. g. aphakic patients , pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
No interactions are anticipated in humans , since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low ( less than 0.2 ng / ml ) following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways , and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies ..
In clinical studies , LUMIGAN was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions .
Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women .
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses ( see section 5.3 ) .
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
3 Lactation It is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human milk , however , this substance is excreted in rat milk after intravenous administration .
It is recommended that LUMIGAN is not used in nursing mothers .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
As with any ocular treatment , if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical studies , over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN .
On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN usage , the most frequently reported treatment- related adverse events were : growth of eyelashes in up to 45 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7 % at 2 years and 2 % at 3 years , conjunctival hyperaemia ( mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature ) in up to 44 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13 % at 2 years and 12 % at 3 years and ocular pruritus in up to 14 % of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 3 % at 2 years and 0 % at 3 years .
Less than 9 % of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations being 3 % at both 2 and 3 years .
The following undesirable effects definitely , probably or possibly related to treatment were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN . Most were ocular , mild to moderate , and none was serious :
With each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness
Infections and infestations Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : infection ( primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections )
Nervous system disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : headache Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : dizziness
Eye disorders Very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) : conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes , ocular pruritus
Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : allergic conjunctivitis , asthenopia , blepharitis , cataract , conjunctival oedema , corneal erosion , eye discharge , eyelash darkening , eye pain , foreign body sensation , increased iris pigmentation , ocular burning , ocular dryness , ocular irritation , photophobia , superficial punctate keratitis , tearing , visual disturbance and worsening of visual acuity
Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : blepharospasm , cystoid macular oedema , eyelid retraction , iritis , retinal haemorrhage , uveitis .
Vascular disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : hypertension
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : eyelid erythema , eyelid pruritus , pigmentation of periocular skin Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : eyelid oedema , hirsutism .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : asthenia , peripheral oedema
4 Investigations Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : liver function test abnormal
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported , and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration .
If overdosage occurs , treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .
If LUMIGAN is accidentally ingested , the following information may be useful : in two-week oral rat and mouse studies , doses up to 100 mg / kg / day did not produce any toxicity .
This dose expressed as mg / m2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN in a 10 kg child .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : other antiglaucoma preparations ; ATC code :
S01EE03
The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow .
Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours .
The duration of effect is maintained for at least 24 hours .
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent .
It is a synthetic prostamide , structurally related to prostaglandin F2α ( PGF2α ) , that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors .
Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides .
The prostamide receptor , however , has not yet been structurally identified .
During 12 months &quot; monotherapy treatment , versus timolol , mean change from baseline in morning ( 08 : 00 ) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mm Hg .
At any visit , the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg .
In a 6-month clinical study , versus latanoprost , a statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP ( ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus - 6.0 to - 7.2 mmHg for latanoprost ) was observed at all visits throughout the study .
Conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes , and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with latanoprost , however , the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically significant difference .
Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone , adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and bimatoprost lowered mean morning ( 08 : 00 ) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg .
Limited experience is available with the use in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma , and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy .
No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials .
5 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro .
After ocular administration , the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time .
After once daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.03 % bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks , blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection ( 0.025 ng / ml ) within 1.5 hours after dosing .
Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng / ml and 0.09 ng • hr / ml respectively , indicating that a steady drug concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 l / kg .
In human blood , bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma .
The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 % .
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation , N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites .
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion , up to 67 % of an intravenous dose administered to healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine , 25 % of the dose was excreted via the faeces .
The elimination half-life , determined after intravenous administration , was approximately 45 minutes ; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l / hr / kg .
Characteristics in elderly patients :
After twice daily dosing , the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 ng • hr / ml bimatoprost in the elderly ( subjects 65 years or older ) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng • hr / ml in young healthy adults .
However , this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing .
There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use .
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥ 0.03 % daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and / or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure .
The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in melanocyte number .
No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed , and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown .
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies .
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg / kg / day ( approximately 103-times the intended human exposure ) .
In embryo / foetal developmental studies abortion , but no developmental effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the dose in humans , respectively .
These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher , respectively , than the intended human exposure .
In rat peri / postnatal studies , maternal toxicity caused reduced gestation time , foetal death , and decreased pup body weights at ≥ 0.3 mg / kg / day ( at least 41-times the intended human exposure ) .
Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not affected .

Further information
WHAT LUMIGAN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
LUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation .
It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides .
LUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye .
This high pressure can lead to a disease called glaucoma .
If the high pressure is not reduced , it could eventually damage your sight .
Your eye contains a clear , watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye .
Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this .
If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough , the pressure inside the eye builds up .
LUMIGAN works by increasing the amount of liquid that is drained .
This reduces the pressure inside the eye .
LUMIGAN may be used on its own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure .
BEFORE YOU USE LUMIGAN
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of LUMIGAN .
Take special care with LUMIGAN :
- Talk to your doctor , if :
- - -
You have any breathing problems .
You have liver or kidney problems . You have had a cataract surgery in the past
LUMIGAN may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow , and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too .
The colour of your iris may also go darker over time .
These changes may be permanent .
The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye .
People under 18 must not use LUMIGAN .
19 Using other medicines : Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , or have recently taken , any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
If you use LUMIGAN with another eye drop , leave at least five minutes between putting in LUMIGAN and then the other drops .
Pregnancy Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor still recommends it .
Breast-feeding LUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN .
Driving and using machines : Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN .
You should not drive or use machines until your sight is clear again .
Important information about some of the ingredients of LUMIGAN Do not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses .
Wait 15 minutes after using the drops before you put your lenses back in .
A preservative in LUMIGAN called benzalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation and can discolour soft contact lenses .
HOW TO USE LUMIGAN
LUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Recommended dosage in adults ( including the elderly )
The recommended dose is one drop of GANFORT in the affected eye ( s ) once daily , administered in the morning .
If one dose is missed , treatment should continue with the next dose as planned .
The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye ( s ) daily .
If more than one topical ophthalmic product is to be used , the different products should be instilled at least 5 minutes apart .
Use in renal and hepatic impairment
GANFORT has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment . Therefore caution should be used in treating such patients .
Use in children and adolescents
GANFORT has only been studied in adults and therefore its use is not recommended in children or adolescents .
4.3 Contraindications
Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Sinus bradycardia , second or third degree atrioventricular block , overt cardiac failure , cardiogenic shock .
2 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents , GANFORT may be absorbed systemically .
No enhancement of the systemic absorption of the individual active substances has been observed .
Due to the beta-adrenergic component , timolol , the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-blockers may occur .
Cardiac failure should be adequately controlled before beginning GANFORT therapy .
Patients with a history of severe cardiac disease should be watched for signs of cardiac failure and have their pulse rates checked .
Cardiac and respiratory reactions , including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma , and , rarely , death in association with cardiac failures have been reported following administration of timolol maleate .
Beta-blockers may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism and cause worsening of Prinzmetal angina , severe peripheral and central circulatory disorders and hypotension .
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients ( especially those with labile diabetes ) as beta-blockers may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia .
While taking beta-blockers , patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be unresponsive to the usual dose of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions .
In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and / or bilirubin at baseline , bimatoprost had no adverse reactions on liver function over 24 months .
There are no known adverse reactions of ocular timolol on liver function .
Before treatment is initiated , patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth , darkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation since these have been observed during treatment with bimatoprost and GANFORT .
Some of these changes may be permanent , and may lead to differences in appearance between the eyes if only one eye is treated .
After discontinuation of GANFORT , pigmentation of iris may be permanent .
After 12 months treatment with GANFORT , the incidence of iris pigmentation was 0.2 % .
After 12 months treatment with bimatoprost eye drops alone , the incidence was 1.5 % and did not increase following 3 years treatment .
Cystoid macular oedema has been reported with GANFORT .
Therefore , GANFORT should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema ( e. g. aphakic patients , pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule ) .
The preservative in GANFORT , benzalkonium chloride , may cause eye irritation .
Contact lenses must be removed prior to application , with at least a 15-minute wait before reinsertion .
Benzalkonium chloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses .
Contact with soft contact lenses must be avoided .
Benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Therefore monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use of GANFORT in dry eye patients or where the cornea is compromised .
GANFORT has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions , neovascular , inflammatory , angle-closure glaucoma , congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma .
3 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
There is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension , and / or marked bradycardia when eye drops containing timolol are administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers , guanethidine , or beta-blocking agents , anti-arrhythmics , digitalis glycosides or parasympathomimetics .
Beta-blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic agents .
Beta-blockers can mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta-blockers .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of GANFORT in pregnant women .
Bimatoprost No adequate clinical data in exposed pregnancies are available .
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses ( see section 5.3 ) .
Timolol Epidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but shown a risk for intra uterine growth retardation when beta-blockers are administered by the oral route .
In addition , signs and symptoms of beta-blockade ( e. g. bradycardia , hypotension , respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia ) have been observed in the neonate when beta-blockers have been administered until delivery .
If GANFORT is administered until delivery , the neonate should be carefully monitored during the first days of life .
Animal studies with timolol have shown reproductive toxicity at doses significantly higher than would be used in clinical practice ( see section 5.3 ) .
Consequently , GANFORT should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Lactation Timolol is excreted in breast milk .
It is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk but it is excreted in the milk of the lactating rat .
GANFORT should not be used by breast-feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
GANFORT has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
As with any ocular treatment , if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects
No adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) specific for GANFORT have been observed in clinical studies .
The ADRs have been limited to those earlier reported for bimatoprost and timolol .
The majority of ADRs were ocular , mild in severity and none were serious .
Based on 12-month clinical data , the most commonly reported ADR was conjunctival hyperaemia ( mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature ) in approximately 26 % of patients and led to discontinuation in 1.5 % of patients .
The following ADRs were reported during clinical trials with GANFORT ( within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness ) :
4 Nervous system disorders Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : headache
Eye disorders Very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) : conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes .
Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : superficial punctuate keratitis , corneal erosion , burning sensation , eye pruritus , stinging sensation in the eye , foreign body sensation , eye dryness , eyelid erythema , eye pain , photophobia , eye discharge , visual disturbance , eyelid pruritus .
Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : iritis , eye irritation , conjunctival oedema , blepharitis , epiphora , eyelid oedema , eyelid pain , visual acuity worsened , asthenopia , trichiasis .
Not known : cystoid macular oedema .
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : rhinitis
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : blepharal pigmentation Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : hirsutism
Additional adverse events that have been seen with one of the components and may potentially occur also with GANFORT :
Bimatoprost Infections and infestations : infection ( primarily colds and upper respiratory symptoms ) .
Nervous system disorders : dizziness Eye disorders : allergic conjunctivitis , cataract , eyelash darkening , increased iris pigmentation , blepharospasm , eyelid retraction , retinal haemorrhage , uveitis .
Vascular disorders : hypertension .
General disorders and administration site condition : asthenia , peripheral oedema .
Investigations : liver function tests ( LFT ) abnormal .
Timolol Psychiatric disorders : insomnia , nightmares , decreased libido Nervous system disorders : dizziness , memory loss , increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis , paresthaesia , cerebral ischaemia Eye disorders : decreased corneal sensitivity , diplopia , ptosis , choroidal detachment ( following filtration surgery ) , refractive changes ( due to withdrawal of miotic therapy in some cases ) , keratitis .
Ear and labyrinth disorders : tinnitus .
Cardiac disorders : heart block , cardiac arrest , arrhythmia , syncope , bradycardia , cardiac failure , congestive heart failure .

Gastrointestinal disorders : nausea , diarrhoea , dyspepsia , dry mouth .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : alopecia , psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis .
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : systemic lupus erythematosus .
Renal and urinary disorders :
Peyronie &quot; s disease .
General disorders and administration site conditions : oedema , chest pain , fatigue .
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported , and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration .
Bimatoprost If GANFORT is accidentally ingested , the following information may be useful : in two-week oral rat and mouse studies , doses of bimatoprost up to 100 mg / kg / day did not produce any toxicity .
This dose 5 expressed as mg / m2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of GANFORT in a 10 kg child .
Timolol Symptoms of systemic timolol overdose are : bradycardia , hypotension , bronchospasm , headache , dizziness , shortness of breath , and cardiac arrest .
A study of patients showed that timolol did not dialyse readily .
If overdose occurs treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Ophthalmological - beta-blocking agents - timolol , combinations , ATC code :
S01ED 51
Mechanism of action :
GANFORT consists of two active substances : bimatoprost and timolol maleate .
These two components decrease elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) by complementary mechanisms of action and the combined effect results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound administered alone .
GANFORT has a rapid onset of action .
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent .
It is a synthetic prostamide , structurally related to prostaglandin F2α ( PGF2α ) that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors .
Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides .
The prostamide receptor , however , has not yet been structurally identified .
The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow .
Timolol is a beta1 and beta2 non-selective adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic , direct myocardial depressant , or local anaesthetic ( membrane-stabilising ) activity .
Timolol lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humour formation .
The precise mechanism of action is not clearly established , but inhibition of the increased cyclic AMP synthesis caused by endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation is probable .
Clinical effects :
The IOP-lowering effect of GANFORT is non-inferior to that achieved by adjunctive therapy of bimatoprost ( once daily ) and timolol ( twice daily ) .
There are no studies with evening dosing of GANFORT .
Morning dosing of GANFORT is therefore recommended to ensure maximal IOP-lowering effect at the time of the physiological IOP rise .
However , if necessary for patient compliance , an evening dosing may be considered .
Once-daily dosing of timolol 0.5 % has a rapid onset of maximal effect , corresponding with the time of this rise , and maintains clinically meaningful IOP-lowering over the 24-hour period .
Bimatoprost studies show comparable IOP control regardless of morning or evening dosing .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
GANFORT :
Plasma bimatoprost and timolol concentrations were determined in a crossover study comparing the monotherapy treatments to GANFORT treatment in healthy subjects .
Systemic absorption of the individual components was minimal and not affected by co-administration in a single formulation .
6 In two 12-month studies where systemic absorption was measured , no accumulation was observed with either of the individual components .
Bimatoprost :
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro .
After ocular administration , the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time .
After once daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.03 % bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks , blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection ( 0.025 ng / ml ) within 1.5 hours after dosing .
Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng / ml and 0.09 ng • hr / ml respectively , indicating that a steady drug concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 1 / kg .
In human blood , bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma .
The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 % .
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation , N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites .
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion , up to 67 % of an intravenous dose administered to healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine , 25 % of the dose was excreted via the faeces .
The elimination half-life , determined after intravenous administration , was approximately 45 minutes ; the total blood clearance was 1.5 1 / hr / kg .
Characteristics in elderly patients :
After twice daily dosing , the mean AUC 0-24hrs value of 0.0634 ng • hr / ml bimatoprost in the elderly ( subjects 65 years or older ) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng • hr / ml in young healthy adults .
However , this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing .
There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients .
Timolol :
After ocular administration of a 0.5 % eye drops solution in humans undergoing cataract surgery , peak timolol concentration was 898 ng / ml in the aqueous humour at one hour post-dose .
Part of the dose is absorbed systemically where it is extensively metabolised in the liver .
The half-life of timolol in plasma is about 4 to 6 hours .
Timolol is partially metabolised by the liver with timolol and its metabolites excreted by the kidney .
Timolol is not extensively bound to plasma .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose ocular toxicity studies on GANFORT showed no special hazard for humans .
The ocular and systemic safety profile of the individual components is well established .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential .
Studies in rodents produced species-specific abortion at systemic exposure levels 33- to 97-times that achieved in humans after ocular administration .
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥ 0.03 % daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and / or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure .
The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in 7 melanocyte number .
No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed , and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Further information
WHAT GANFORT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GANFORT is an eye drop that is used to control glaucoma .
It contains two different active substances ( bimatoprost and timolol ) that both reduce high pressure in the eye .
Bimatoprost belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides .
Timolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers .
GANFORT is prescribed to reduce high pressure in the eye .
Your eye contains a clear , watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye .
Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this .
If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough , the pressure inside the eye builds up and could eventually damage your sight .
GANFORT works by reducing the production of liquid and also increasing the amount of liquid that is drained .
This reduces the pressure inside the eye .
BEFORE YOU USE GANFORT
Do not use GANFORT :
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to bimatoprost , timolol or any of the other ingredients of
GANFORT
- if you have any breathing illnesses such as asthma or a history of asthma , or severe chronic
obstructive lung disease
- if you have heart problems such as heart weakness or heart beat disorders
Take special care with GANFORT :
Before you use this medicine , tell your doctor
- if you have now or have had in the past
• heart , blood pressure or breathing problems • overactivity of the thyroid • diabetes or low blood sugar levels ( hypoglycaemia ) • severe allergic reactions • liver or kidney problems • known risk factors for macular oedema ( swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening vision ) , for example , cataract surgery
20 GANFORT may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow , and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too .
The colour of your iris may also go darker over time .
These changes may be permanent .
The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye .
GANFORT should not be used in people under 18 unless your doctor still recommends it .
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
If you use GANFORT with another eye medicine , leave at least 5 minutes between putting in GANFORT and the other medicine .
Use any eye ointment or eye gel last .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant .
GANFORT should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor still recommends it .
GANFORT should not be used if you are breast-feeding .
Driving and using machines GANFORT may cause blurred vision in some patients .
Do not drive or use machinery until the symptoms have cleared .
Important information about some of the ingredients of GANFORT Do not use the drops while your contact lenses are in your eyes .
Wait at least 15 minutes after using the eye drops before putting your lenses back in your eyes .
A preservative in GANFORT ( benzalkonium chloride ) may cause eye irritation and is also known to discolour soft contact lenses .
HOW TO USE GANFORT
Always use GANFORT exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
The usual dose is one drop in the morning in each eye that needs treatment .
However , your doctor may recommend you apply the drop in the evening instead .
Instructions for use You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it .
1 .
Wash your hands .
Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling .
Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket .
Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment .
Let go of the lower lid , and close your eye for 30 seconds .
If a drop misses your eye , try again .
To avoid contamination , do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or anything else .
Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it .
21 If you use more GANFORT than you should If you use more GANFORT than you should , it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm .
Put your next dose in at the usual time .
If you are worried , talk to your doctor or pharmacist .
If you forget to use GANFORT If you forget to use GANFORT , use a single drop as soon as you remember , and then go back to your regular routine .
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
If you stop using GANFORT GANFORT should be used every day to work properly .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1 .
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
AZARGA 10 mg / ml + 5 mg / ml eye drops , suspension
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One ml of suspension contains 10 mg brinzolamide and 5 mg timolol ( as timolol maleate ) .
Excipients :
One ml of suspension contains 0.10 mg benzalkonium chloride .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Eye drops , suspension ( eye drops ) White to off-white uniform suspension , pH 7.2 ( approximately ) .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Decrease of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction . ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Use in adults , including the elderly The dose is one drop of AZARGA in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye ( s ) twice daily .
Nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation is recommended .
This may reduce the systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a decrease in systemic adverse reactions .
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used , the medicines must be administered at least 5 minutes apart .
If a dose is missed , treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned .
The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye ( s ) twice daily .
When substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with AZARGA , the other agent should be discontinued and AZARGA should be started the following day .
Paediatric patients AZARGA is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
2 Use in hepatic and renal impairment No studies have been conducted with AZARGA or with timolol 5 mg / ml eye drops in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment or in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
AZARGA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis .
Since brinzolamide and its main metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney , AZARGA is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( see section 4.3 ) .
Method of administration For ocular use .
Instruct patients to shake the bottle well before use .
To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution , care must be taken not to touch the eyelids , surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle .
Instruct patients to keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances , or to any of the excipients . Bronchial asthma , a history of bronchial asthma , or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
• Sinus bradycardia , second or third degree atrioventricular block , overt cardiac failure , or cardiogenic shock . • • • • Severe allergic rhinitis and bronchial hyperreactivity ; hypersensitivity to other beta-blockers . Hyperchloraemic acidosis ( see section 4.2 ) . Severe renal impairment . Hypersensitivity to sulphonamides ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Systemic effects Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents , brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed systemically .
Due to the beta-adrenergic component , timolol , the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur .
Cardiac failure should be adequately controlled before beginning therapy with timolol .
Patients with a history of severe cardiac disease should be watched for signs of cardiac failure and have their pulse rates checked .
Respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions , including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma and , rarely , death in association with cardiac failure , have been reported following administration of timolol maleate .
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycaemia or to patients with labile insulin-dependent diabetes as beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycaemia .
They may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism and cause worsening of Prinzmetal angina , severe peripheral and central circulatory disorders and hypotension .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide , a sulphonamide .
The same types of undesirable effects that are attributable to sulphonamides may occur with topical administration .
Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur , discontinue the use of this medicinal product .
There is potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZARGA .
The concomitant administration of AZARGA and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not recommended ( see section 4.5 ) .
3 Anaphylactic reactions While taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents , patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be unresponsive to the usual doses of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions .
Concomitant therapy Timolol may interact with other medicinal products ( see section 4.5 ) .
The effect on intraocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta blockade may be potentiated when AZARGA is given to patients already receiving an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent .
The use of two local beta-adrenergic blocking agents or two local carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended .
Ocular effects There is limited experience with AZARGA in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma .
Caution should be utilised in treating these patients and close monitoring of IOP is recommended .
AZARGA has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and its use is not recommended in these patients .
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and / or physical coordination in elderly patients .
AZARGA is absorbed systemically and therefore this may occur with topical administration .
The possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients with compromised corneas ( particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count ) .
Specifically , patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when using brinzolamide is recommended , since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration and wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea .
Careful monitoring of patients with compromised corneas , such as patients with diabetes mellitus or corneal dystrophies , is recommended .
Benzalkonium chloride , which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products , has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Since AZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride , close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use
AZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses .
Contact with soft contact lenses is to be avoided .
Patients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the application of AZARGA and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with AZARGA .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and , although administered topically , is absorbed systemically .
Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
The potential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving AZARGA .
The cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4 ( main ) , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 .
It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole , itraconazole , clotrimazole , ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide by CYP3A4 .
Caution is advised if CYP3A 4 inhibitors are given concomitantly .
However , accumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route .
Brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isozymes .
4 There is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension and / or marked bradycardia when eye drops with timolol are administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers , guanethidine or beta-blocking agents , antiarrhythmics , digitalis glycosides or parasympathomimetics .
The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta-blockers .
Potentiated systemic beta-blockade ( e.g. decreased heart rate ) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors ( e.g. quinidine , cimetidine ) and timolol .
Beta-blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic agents .
Beta-blockers can mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of brinzolamide in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Well-controlled epidemiological studies with systemic use of beta-blockers did not indicate malformative effects , but some pharmacological effects such as bradycardia have been observed in foetuses or neonates .
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of timolol in eye drops on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn child but bradycardia and arrhythmia have been reported in one case in the foetus of a woman treated with timolol eye drops .
To date , no other relevant epidemiological data are available .
AZARGA should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Lactation It is not known whether brinzolamide is excreted in human breast milk .
Animal studies have shown excretion of brinzolamide in breast milk .
Timolol does appear in human breast milk .
However , at therapeutic doses of AZARGA , no effects on the breastfed newborns / infants are anticipated .
AZARGA can be used during breast-feeding .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
As with any eye drops , temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines .
If blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines .
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability of elderly patients to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and / or physical coordination ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile In two clinical trials of 6 and 12 months duration involving 394 patients treated with AZARGA , the most frequently reported adverse reaction was transient blurred vision upon instillation ( 3.6 % ) , lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes .
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions The following adverse reactions are classified according to the following convention : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , or very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

Description of selected adverse reactions Dysgeusia ( bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation ) was a frequently reported systemic adverse reaction associated with the use of AZARGA during clinical trials .
It is likely to be caused by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal and is attributable to brinzolamide .
Nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the occurrence of this effect ( see section 4.2 ) .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide which is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption .
Gastrointestinal , nervous system , haematological , renal and metabolic effects are generally associated with systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
The same type of adverse reactions attributable to oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antiglaucoma preparation and miotics ATC code :
S01ED51
Mechanism of action AZARGA contains two active substances : brinzolamide and timolol maleate .
These two components decrease elevated IOP primarily by reducing aqueous humour secretion , but do so by different mechanisms of action .
The combined effect of these two active substances results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound alone .
8 Brinzolamide is a potent inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II ( CA-II ) , the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye .
Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour secretion , presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport .
Timolol is a non-selective adrenergic-blocking agent that has no intrinsic sympathomimetic , direct myocardial depressant or membrane-stabilising activity .
Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action is related to reduced aqueous humour formation and a slight increase in outflow facility .
Pharmacodynamic effects Clinical effects :
In a twelve-month , controlled clinical trial in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who , in the investigator &apos;s opinion could benefit from a combination therapy , and who had baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg , the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice daily was 7 to 9 mmHg .
The non-inferiority of AZARGA as compared to dorzolamide 20 mg / ml + timolol 5 mg / ml in the mean IOP reduction was demonstrated across all time-points at all visits .
In a six-month , controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg , the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice daily was 7 to 9 mmHg , and was up to 3 mmHg greater than that of brinzolamide 10 mg / ml dosed twice daily and up to 2 mmHg greater than that of timolol 5 mg / ml dosed twice daily .
A statistically superior reduction in mean IOP was observed compared to both brinzolamide and timolol at all time-points and visits throughout the study .
In three controlled clinic al trials , the ocular discomfort upon instillation of AZARGA was significantly lower than that of dorzolamide 20 mg / ml + timolol 5 mg / ml .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following topical ocular administration , brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed through the cornea and into the systemic circulation .
In a pharmacokinetic study , healthy subjects received oral brinzolamide ( 1 mg ) twice daily for 2 weeks to shorten the time to reach steady-state prior to starting AZARGA administration .
Following twice daily dosing of AZARGA for 13 weeks , red blood cell ( RBC ) concentrations of brinzolamide averaged 18.8 ± 3.29 µM , 18.1 ± 2.68 µM and 18.4 ± 3.01 µM at weeks 4 , 10 and 15 , respectively , indicating that steady-state RBC concentrations of brinzolamide were maintained
At steady state , following administration of AZARGA , the mean plasma Cmax and AUC0-12h of timolol were 27 % and 28 % lower ( Cmax :
0.824 ± 0.453 ng / ml ; AUC0-12h :
4.71 ± 4.29 ng · h / ml ) , respectively , in comparison to the administration of timolol 5 mg / ml ( Cmax :
1.13 ± 0.494 ng / ml ; AUC0-12h :
6.58 ± 3.18 ng · h / ml ) .
The lower systemic exposure to timolol following AZARGA administration is not clinically relevant .
Following administration of AZARGA , mean Cmax of timolol was reached at 0.79 ± 0.45 hours .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of brinzolamide is moderate ( about 60 % ) .
Brinzolamide is sequestered in RBCs due to its high affinity binding to CA-II and to a lesser extent to CA-I .
Its active N-desethyl metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I .
The affinity of brinzolamide and metabolite to RBC and tissue CA results in low plasma concentrations .
Ocular tissue distribution data in rabbits showed that timolol can be measured in aqueous humour up to 48 hours after administration of AZARGA .
At steady-state , timolol is detected in human plasma for up to 12 hours after administration of AZARGA .
9 Metabolism The metabolic pathways for the metabolism of brinzolamide involve N-dealkylation , O-dealkylation and oxidation of its N-propyl side chain .
N-desethyl brinzolamide is a major metabolite of brinzolamide formed in humans , which also binds to CA-I in the presence of brinzolamide and accumulates in RBCs .
In vitro studies show that the metabolism of brinzolamide mainly involves CYP3A4 as well as at least four other isozymes ( CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 ) .
Timolol is metabolised by two pathways .
One route yields an ethanolamine side chain on the thiadiazole ring and the other giving an ethanolic side chain on the morpholine nitrogen and a second similar side chain with a carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen .
Timolol metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP2D6 .
Excretion Brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal excretion ( approximately 60 % ) .
About 20 % of the dose has been accounted for in urine as metabolite .
Brinzolamide and N-desethyl-brinzolamide are the predominant components found in the urine along with trace levels ( &lt; 1 % ) of the N-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites .
Timolol and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys .
Approximately 20 % of a timolol dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and the remainder excreted in urine as metabolites .
The plasma t1 / 2 of timolol is 4.8 hours after administration of AZARGA .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Brinzolamide
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with brinzolamide based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , and carcinogenic potential .
Developmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg / kg / day ( 214 times the recommended daily clinical dose of 28 µg / kg / day ) revealed no effect on foetal development despite significant maternal toxicity .
Similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of skull and sternebrae of foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg / kg / day ( 642 times the recommended daily clinical dose ) , but not 6 mg / kg / day .
These findings occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights .
Dose-related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally ranging from a slight decrease ( about 5-6 % ) at 2 mg / kg / day to nearly 14 % at 18 mg / kg / day .
During lactation , the no adverse effect level in the offspring was 5 mg / kg / day .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with timolol based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , and carcinogenic potential .
Reproduction toxicity studies with timolol showed delayed foetal ossification in rats with no adverse effects on postnatal development ( at 50 mg / kg / day or 3500 times the daily clinical dose of 14 μg / kg / day ) and increased foetal resorptions in rabbits ( at 90 mg / kg / day or 6400 times the daily clinical dose ) .

22 • Get the AZARGA bottle and a mirror . • Wash your hands . • Shake well before use . • Twist off the bottle cap . • Hold the bottle , pointing down , between your thumb and fingers . • Tilt your head back .
Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger , until there is a &apos; pocket &quot; between the eyelid and your eye .
The drop will go in here ( picture 1 ) . • Bring the bottle tip close to the eye .
Use the mirror if it helps . • Do not touch your eye or eyelid , surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper .
It could infect the drops . • Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of AZARGA at a time . • Do not squeeze the bottle : it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs ( picture 2 ) . • After using AZARGA , press a finger into the corner of your eye , by the nose ( picture 3 ) .
This helps to stop AZARGA getting into the rest of the body . • If you use drops in both eyes , repeat the steps for your other eye . • Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use . • Use up one bottle before opening the next bottle .
If a drop misses your eye , try again .
If you use more AZARGA than you should , rinse your eye with warm water .
Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose .
If you forget to use AZARGA , continue with the next dose as planned .
Do not use a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose .
Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye ( s ) twice daily .
If you stop using AZARGA without speaking to your doctor , the pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight .
If you are using other eye drops , wait at least 5 minutes between using AZARGA and the other drops .
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs .
4.2 Indications for use , specifying the target species
For use in combination with standard therapy ( including diuretic support , where necessary ) for the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular regurgitation in dogs .
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in animals used for , or intended for use in breeding .
Do not use the product in dogs suffering from hypoadrenocorticism , hyperkalaemia or hyponatraemia .
Do not administer spironolactone in conjunction with NSAIDs to dogs with renal insufficiency .
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None
2 / 25 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals Kidney function and serum potassium levels should be evaluated before initiating combined treatment with spironolactone and ACE inhibitors .
Unlike in humans , an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia was not observed in clinical trials performed in dogs with this combination .
However , in dogs with renal impairment regular monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels is recommended as there may be an increased risk of hyperkalaemia .
Dogs treated concomitantly with spironolactone and NSAIDs should be correctly hydrated .
Monitoring of their renal function and plasma potassium levels is recommended before initiation and during treatment with combined therapy ( see 4.3 ) .
As spironolactone has an antiandrogenic effect , it is not recommended to administer the product to growing dogs .
As spironolactone undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation , care should be taken when using the product to treat dogs with hepatic dysfunction .
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals May cause skin sensitisation : persons known to be allergic to spironolactone should not handle the product .
Wash hands after use .
In the event of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
4.6 Adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
A reversible prostatic atrophy is often observed in entire male dogs .
4.7 Use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
Do not use during pregnancy and lactation because developmental toxicity has been observed in laboratory species .
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In clinical studies , PRILACTONE was co-administered with furosemide and pimobendan without evidence of associated adverse reactions .
Spironolactone decreases digoxin elimination and hence raises digoxin plasma concentration .
As the therapeutic index for digoxin is very narrow , it is advisable to monitor closely dogs receiving both digoxin and spironolactone .
The administration of either deoxycorticosterone or NSAIDs with spironolactone may lead to a moderate reduction of the natriuretic effects ( reduction of urinary sodium excretion ) of spironolactone .
Concomitant administration of spironolactone with ACE-inhibitors and other potassium-sparing drugs ( as angiotensin receptor blockers , ß-blockers , calcium channels blockers , etc .. ) may potentially lead to hyperkalaemia ( see 4.5 ) .
Spironolactone may cause both induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes and could therefore affect the metabolism of other drugs utilizing these metabolic pathways .
3 / 25 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use .
2 mg of spironolactone per kg of body weight once daily .
The product should be administered with food .
The tablet can either be mixed with a small amount of food offered prior to the main meal , or administered directly into the mouth after feeding .

4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
After administration of up to 10 times the recommended dose ( 20 mg / kg ) to healthy dogs , dose- dependent adverse effects were noted , see section 4.6 .
In case of an accidental massive ingestion by a dog , there is no specific antidote or treatment .
It is therefore recommended to induce vomiting , lavage the stomach ( depending on risk assessment ) and monitor electrolytes .
Symptomatic treatment , e. g . , fluid therapy , should be provided .
4.11 Withdrawal period ( s )

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Aldosterone antagonist . ATCvet code :
QC03DA01 .
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Spironolactone and its active metabolites ( including 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone ) act as specific antagonists of aldosterone , and exert their effects by binding competitively to the mineralocorticoid receptor located in the kidneys , heart and blood vessels .
Spironolactone is a natriuretic drug ( historically described as a soft diuretic ) .
In the kidney , spironolactone inhibits the aldosterone-induced sodium retention leading to increase in sodium and subsequently water excretion , and potassium retention .
4 / 25 The renal effects of spironolactone and its metabolites lead to a decrease in extracellular volume and consequently in a decrease of cardiac preload and left atrial pressure .
The result is an improvement in heart function .
In the cardiovascular system , spironolactone prevents the detrimental effects of aldosterone .
Although the precise mechanism of action is not yet clearly defined , aldosterone promotes myocardial fibrosis , myocardial and vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction .
In experimental models in dogs , it was shown that long term therapy with an aldosterone antagonist prevents progressive left ventricle dysfunction and attenuates left ventricle remodelling in dogs with chronic heart failure .
In a clinical trial , dogs treated with spironolactone in addition to standard therapy ( ACE-inhibitors ) demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease deterioration compared to dogs treated with standard therapy alone .
When used in combination with ACE-inhibitors , spironolactone may counteract the effects of &quot; aldosterone escape . &quot;
A slight increase in aldosterone blood levels may be observed in animals on treatment .
This is thought to be due to activation of feedback mechanisms without adverse clinical consequence .
There may be a dose related hypertrophy of the adrenal zona glomerulosa at high dose rates .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone are based on its metabolites , as the parent compound is unstable at assay .
Absorption After oral administration of spironolactone to dogs , it was demonstrated that the three metabolites achieved levels of 32 to 49 % of the administered dose .
Food increases the bioavailability to 80 to 90 % .
Following oral administration of 2 to 4 mg / kg , absorption increases linearly over the range .
After multiple oral doses of 2 mg spironolactone per kg for 10 consecutive days , no accumulation is observed .
Mean Cmax of 382 µg / l and 94 µg / l are achieved for the primary metabolites , 7α -thiomethyl- spironolactone and canrenone , after 2 and 4 hours , respectively .
Steady-state conditions are reached by day 2 .
Distribution The mean volumes of distribution ( Vss ) of 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone are approximately 153 litres and 177 litres respectively .
The mean residence time of the metabolites ranges from 9 to 14 hours and they are preferentially distributed to the gastro-intestinal tract , kidney , liver and adrenal glands .
Metabolism Spironolactone is rapidly and completely metabolised by the liver into its active metabolites , 7α - thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone , which are the primary metabolites in the dog .
Elimination Spironolactone is mainly excreted via its metabolites .
Plasma clearance of canrenone is 1.45 ± 0.39 l / h / kg and 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone is 0.89 ± 0.44 l / h / kg .
After oral administration of radiolabelled spironolactone to the dog , 70 % of the dose is recovered in faeces and 20 % in the urine .

Monitoring of their renal function and plasma potassium levels is recommended before initiation and during treatment with combined therapy ( see Contraindications ) .
In the event of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
Interactions In clinical studies , PRILACTONE was co-administered with furosemide and pimobendan without evidence of associated adverse reactions .
As the therapeutic index for digoxin is very narrow , it is advisable to monitor closely dogs receiving both digoxin and spironolactone .
The administration of either deoxycorticosterone or NSAIDs with spironolactone may lead to a moderate reduction of the natriuretic effects ( reduction of urinary sodium excretion ) of spironolactone .
Concomitant administration of spironolactone with ACE-inhibitors and other potassium-sparing drugs ( as angiotensin receptor blockers , ß-blockers , calcium channels blockers , etc ) may potentially lead to hyperkalaemia .
( See Special precautions for use in animals ) .
24 / 25 Overdose After administration of up to 10 times the recommended dose ( 20 mg / kg ) to healthy dogs , dose- dependent adverse effects were noted ( see Adverse Reactions ) .
In case of an accidental massive ingestion by the dog , there is no specific antidote or treatment .
It is therefore recommended to induce vomiting , lavage the stomach ( depending on risk assessment ) and monitor electrolytes .
