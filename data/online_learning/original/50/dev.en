1 .
Introduction and background
Germany , reference member state in the decentralised procedure , notified the EMEA on 21 December 2008 that the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Veterinary ( CMD ( v ) ) failed to reach an agreement for Compagel gel for horses .
Pursuant to Article 33 ( 4 ) of Council Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , the matter was referred to the CVMP .
France and Sweden consider that due to the absence of efficacy documentation it cannot be assumed that the product is efficacious and that this as such presents a potential serious risk to animal health .
CVMP noted that Compagel gel for horses is a generic of Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) and that the concerns raised by France and Sweden can only be addressed in the framework of this procedure , in case any differences between the two products would justify different conclusions on the safety or efficacy .
CVMP started the procedure on 16 January 2008 .
A list of questions was adopted the same day and sent to the applicant , by which the procedure clock was stopped .
On 22 January 2008 responses to the questions were received from applicant and the clock restarted .
The aim of the assessment is to establish whether marketing authorisations of veterinary medicinal products included in the referral procedure should be maintained , suspended , varied or revoked with view to the grounds for referral .
2 .
Discussion
The applicant was requested to provide the following information :
A copy of the information and documents referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 32 ( 1 ) of the Directive and any additional information provided to the Reference Member State during the 60 day CMD ( v ) procedure ( rapporteurs and EMEA only ) .
In view of the concerns raised by France and Sweden , to indicate and to substantiate where necessary , any differences between Compagel gel for horses and reference product Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) that could justify different conclusions on the efficacy for the two products .
In response to question 1 , the applicant provided a copy of the original dossier as submitted in support of the application of a mutual recognition procedure , and any supplementary data submitted during the mutual recognition procedure and the referral procedure in CMD ( v ) thereafter .
The application of Compagel gel for horses was based upon Art. 13 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended , in which it is stated that &quot; By way of derogation from point ( j ) of the first subparagraph of Article 12 ( 3 ) , and without prejudice to the law relating to the protection of industrial and commercial property , the applicant shall not be required to provide the results of the safety and residue tests or of the preclinical and clinical trials if he can demonstrate that the medicinal product is a generic of a reference medicinal product which is or has been authorized under Article 5 for not less than eight years in a Member State or the Community . &quot;
Reference is made to the reference product Tensolvet 50000 which has been registered and used over a period of more than eight years in Germany .
All concerned member states in the mutual recognition procedure agreed that Compagel gel for horses is essentially similar to Tensolvet 50000 .
In response to question 2 , the applicant responded that there are no differences at all that would justify different conclusions on the safety and efficacy for the two products .
4 / 7 Under these conditions the applicant is exempted from submitting further preclinical or clinical data on efficacy of the proposed product , and can claim the same indications for use as for the reference product Tensolvet 50000 .
3 .
Conclusions and Recommendations
Compagel gel for horses proved to be essentially similar to the reference product , Tensolvet 50000 .
Consequently , the same conclusions on efficacy and safety apply to both products .
The objections raised by France and Sweden should not prevent the granting of a marketing authorisation for Compagel gel for horses .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR VETERINARY USE ( CVMP )
OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 33 ( 4 ) REFERRAL FOR DOXYPREX 100mg PREMIX
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Doxyprex 100 mg premix presented in 5 kg , 20 kg and 25 kg bags containing 100 mg / g doxycycline base as hyclate .
The product is authorised with the indication the treatment of swine respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella multocida , Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae .
In December 2005 , a Mutual Recognition Procedure ( MRP ) started with Spain acting as Reference Member State and ten Concerned Member States .
Germany could not agree to the granting a marketing authorisation and the matter was referred to the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures , CMD ( v ) , and subsequently to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) .
Germany considered that the product could represent a potential serious risk to animal health on the grounds that the efficacy had not been sufficiently substantiated .
The CVMP during its meeting of 21-22 June 2006 started a referral procedure under Article 33 ( 4 ) of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , for Doxyprex 100 mg premix .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder ( MAH ) was requested to substantiate the efficacy of the product .
The applicant provided a justification for submission of this application on a &quot; well-established use &quot; basis .
Within the EU doxycycline-based premix products for pigs at recommended dose rates of 10mg / kg once daily for 5 days are stated as having been authorised since 1985 .
Similar products with 8 or 10 days treatment durations are also available within the EU .
Annex I of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended by directive 2004 / 28 / EC notes that post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue .
Therefore , the CVMP considered that the reports mentioned above give favourable evidence for the safety and efficacy of doxycycline in general , but also for the specific final formulation as marketed in Spain .
The applicant submitted a scientific report on Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex ( PRDC ) . In the pivotal clinical trial , the presence of P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica was clearly demonstrated in sick pigs , however , no post treatment sampling was done to show bacteriological cure .
The applicant justifies that the presence of M. hyopneumoniae was not determined by bacteriological methods because it was difficult to isolate at that time . The presence was assumed . The applicant provided evidence of efficacy of the active substance , doxycycline , against M. hyopneumoniae in pigs from published literature and from MIC studies . These are all references provided with the original submission . However , the CVMP considered that the fact that no post treatment bacteriological samples were taken mean that bacteriological cure cannot be assumed or claimed . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London , E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged .
The CVMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation to Doxyprex 100 mg / g Premix for medicated feeding stuff for pigs for the following indication because a positive benefit / risk analysis has been demonstrated and no potential serious risk has been identified .
&quot; For the treatment and prevention of porcine respiratory disease , caused by Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica , susceptible to doxycycline , when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd . &quot;
A benefit-risk analysis could not be conducted due to the lack of pivotal evidence on clinical efficacy for the indication M. hyopneumoniae .
Therefore , the recommendation is to remove this pathogen from the indications .
The CVMP Opinion was adopted on 14 February 2007 and the subsequent Commission Decision on 22 May 2007 .

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MARKETING APPLICATION for RIQUENT
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : abetimus
On 13 October 2006 , La Jolla Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Riquent , for the treatment of lupus nephritis .
What is Riquent ?
Riquent is a solution for injection that contains 50 mg / ml of the active substance abetimus .
What was Riquent expected to be used for ?
Riquent was expected to be used to treat lupus nephritis , an inflammation of the kidneys in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE , an auto-immune disease caused by the body &quot; s own defence system attacking normal tissue ) who have a history of kidney disease and have been tested to check that they will benefit from the medicine .
Riquent was expected to delay and to reduce the incidence of &apos; flares &quot; ( increased signs of kidney disease ) .
Because the number of patients with lupus nephritis is low , the disease is rare , and Riquent was designated an orphan medicine ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) on 20 November 2001 .
How is Riquent expected to work ?
Abetimus , the active substance in Riquent , is a selective immunosuppressive agent ( a compound that selectively dampens down the immune system ) .
Most patients with SLE have antibodies in their blood that are directed against double-stranded DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) .
These antibodies are thought to be linked to the development of lupus kidney disease .
Abetimus is a small piece of double-stranded DNA that has been designed to reduce circulating levels of these antibodies .
When Riquent is injected , the levels of these antibodies in the blood are lowered and this is expected to help reduce the patient &quot; s likelihood of experiencing a &apos; flare . &quot;
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of Riquent were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
There were two main studies involving a total of 529 patients with SLE , in which Riquent was compared with a placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
