1 .
Introduction and background
Germany , reference member state in the decentralised procedure , notified the EMEA on 21 December 2008 that the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Veterinary ( CMD ( v ) ) failed to reach an agreement for Compagel gel for horses .
Pursuant to Article 33 ( 4 ) of Council Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , the matter was referred to the CVMP .
France and Sweden consider that due to the absence of efficacy documentation it cannot be assumed that the product is efficacious and that this as such presents a potential serious risk to animal health .
CVMP noted that Compagel gel for horses is a generic of Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) and that the concerns raised by France and Sweden can only be addressed in the framework of this procedure , in case any differences between the two products would justify different conclusions on the safety or efficacy .
CVMP started the procedure on 16 January 2008 .
A list of questions was adopted the same day and sent to the applicant , by which the procedure clock was stopped .
On 22 January 2008 responses to the questions were received from applicant and the clock restarted .
The aim of the assessment is to establish whether marketing authorisations of veterinary medicinal products included in the referral procedure should be maintained , suspended , varied or revoked with view to the grounds for referral .
2 .
Discussion
The applicant was requested to provide the following information :
A copy of the information and documents referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 32 ( 1 ) of the Directive and any additional information provided to the Reference Member State during the 60 day CMD ( v ) procedure ( rapporteurs and EMEA only ) .
In view of the concerns raised by France and Sweden , to indicate and to substantiate where necessary , any differences between Compagel gel for horses and reference product Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) that could justify different conclusions on the efficacy for the two products .
In response to question 1 , the applicant provided a copy of the original dossier as submitted in support of the application of a mutual recognition procedure , and any supplementary data submitted during the mutual recognition procedure and the referral procedure in CMD ( v ) thereafter .
The application of Compagel gel for horses was based upon Art. 13 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended , in which it is stated that &quot; By way of derogation from point ( j ) of the first subparagraph of Article 12 ( 3 ) , and without prejudice to the law relating to the protection of industrial and commercial property , the applicant shall not be required to provide the results of the safety and residue tests or of the preclinical and clinical trials if he can demonstrate that the medicinal product is a generic of a reference medicinal product which is or has been authorized under Article 5 for not less than eight years in a Member State or the Community . &quot;
Reference is made to the reference product Tensolvet 50000 which has been registered and used over a period of more than eight years in Germany .
All concerned member states in the mutual recognition procedure agreed that Compagel gel for horses is essentially similar to Tensolvet 50000 .
In response to question 2 , the applicant responded that there are no differences at all that would justify different conclusions on the safety and efficacy for the two products .
4 / 7 Under these conditions the applicant is exempted from submitting further preclinical or clinical data on efficacy of the proposed product , and can claim the same indications for use as for the reference product Tensolvet 50000 .
3 .
Conclusions and Recommendations
Compagel gel for horses proved to be essentially similar to the reference product , Tensolvet 50000 .
Consequently , the same conclusions on efficacy and safety apply to both products .
The objections raised by France and Sweden should not prevent the granting of a marketing authorisation for Compagel gel for horses .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR VETERINARY USE ( CVMP )
OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 33 ( 4 ) REFERRAL FOR DOXYPREX 100mg PREMIX
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Doxyprex 100 mg premix presented in 5 kg , 20 kg and 25 kg bags containing 100 mg / g doxycycline base as hyclate .
The product is authorised with the indication the treatment of swine respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella multocida , Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae .
In December 2005 , a Mutual Recognition Procedure ( MRP ) started with Spain acting as Reference Member State and ten Concerned Member States .
Germany could not agree to the granting a marketing authorisation and the matter was referred to the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures , CMD ( v ) , and subsequently to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) .
Germany considered that the product could represent a potential serious risk to animal health on the grounds that the efficacy had not been sufficiently substantiated .
The CVMP during its meeting of 21-22 June 2006 started a referral procedure under Article 33 ( 4 ) of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , for Doxyprex 100 mg premix .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder ( MAH ) was requested to substantiate the efficacy of the product .
The applicant provided a justification for submission of this application on a &quot; well-established use &quot; basis .
Within the EU doxycycline-based premix products for pigs at recommended dose rates of 10mg / kg once daily for 5 days are stated as having been authorised since 1985 .
Similar products with 8 or 10 days treatment durations are also available within the EU .
Annex I of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended by directive 2004 / 28 / EC notes that post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue .
Therefore , the CVMP considered that the reports mentioned above give favourable evidence for the safety and efficacy of doxycycline in general , but also for the specific final formulation as marketed in Spain .
The applicant submitted a scientific report on Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex ( PRDC ) . In the pivotal clinical trial , the presence of P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica was clearly demonstrated in sick pigs , however , no post treatment sampling was done to show bacteriological cure .
The applicant justifies that the presence of M. hyopneumoniae was not determined by bacteriological methods because it was difficult to isolate at that time . The presence was assumed . The applicant provided evidence of efficacy of the active substance , doxycycline , against M. hyopneumoniae in pigs from published literature and from MIC studies . These are all references provided with the original submission . However , the CVMP considered that the fact that no post treatment bacteriological samples were taken mean that bacteriological cure cannot be assumed or claimed . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London , E14 4HB , UK Tel .

The CVMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation to Doxyprex 100 mg / g Premix for medicated feeding stuff for pigs for the following indication because a positive benefit / risk analysis has been demonstrated and no potential serious risk has been identified .
&quot; For the treatment and prevention of porcine respiratory disease , caused by Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica , susceptible to doxycycline , when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd . &quot;
A benefit-risk analysis could not be conducted due to the lack of pivotal evidence on clinical efficacy for the indication M. hyopneumoniae .
Therefore , the recommendation is to remove this pathogen from the indications .
The CVMP Opinion was adopted on 14 February 2007 and the subsequent Commission Decision on 22 May 2007 .

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MARKETING APPLICATION for RIQUENT
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : abetimus
On 13 October 2006 , La Jolla Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Riquent , for the treatment of lupus nephritis .
What is Riquent ?
Riquent is a solution for injection that contains 50 mg / ml of the active substance abetimus .
What was Riquent expected to be used for ?
Riquent was expected to be used to treat lupus nephritis , an inflammation of the kidneys in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE , an auto-immune disease caused by the body &quot; s own defence system attacking normal tissue ) who have a history of kidney disease and have been tested to check that they will benefit from the medicine .
Riquent was expected to delay and to reduce the incidence of &apos; flares &quot; ( increased signs of kidney disease ) .
Because the number of patients with lupus nephritis is low , the disease is rare , and Riquent was designated an orphan medicine ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) on 20 November 2001 .
How is Riquent expected to work ?
Abetimus , the active substance in Riquent , is a selective immunosuppressive agent ( a compound that selectively dampens down the immune system ) .
Most patients with SLE have antibodies in their blood that are directed against double-stranded DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) .
These antibodies are thought to be linked to the development of lupus kidney disease .
Abetimus is a small piece of double-stranded DNA that has been designed to reduce circulating levels of these antibodies .
When Riquent is injected , the levels of these antibodies in the blood are lowered and this is expected to help reduce the patient &quot; s likelihood of experiencing a &apos; flare . &quot;
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of Riquent were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
There were two main studies involving a total of 529 patients with SLE , in which Riquent was compared with a placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The studies measured how many patients developed &apos; flares &quot; and the time to the development of the flares by measuring the levels of protein in the urine and of creatinine ( an enzyme that is a marker of kidney function ) in the blood .
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn ?
The application was at day 114 when the company withdrew .
The CHMP was evaluating the initial documentation provided by the company .
The CHMP normally takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application .
Based on the review of the initial documentation , the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120 , which is sent to the company .

The CHMP was evaluating the initial documentation provided by the Company and had not yet made any recommendations .
What were the reasons given by the company to withdraw the application ?
The letter from the company notifying the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here .
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients undergoing clinical trials / compassionate use programmes with Riquent ?
The company informed the CHMP that it plans to continue the ongoing clinical trials in the treatment of lupus nephritis .
The Company has no compassionate use programme .
A compassionate use programme is a programme through which doctors can request a medicine for a specific disease for one of their patients before the medicine is fully authorised .
If you are in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , contact the doctor who is giving it to you .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE ( CHMP ) OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 6 ( 12 ) REFERRAL
Arcoxia
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : etoricoxib
BACKGROUND INFORMATION *
Etoricoxib is a selective inhibitor of COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ) indicated in the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis ( OA , 30-60mg once daily ( od ) ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA , 90mg od ) and the pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis ( 120mg od ) .
This referral procedure relates to a request for arbitration concerning a type II variation for a new indication to include treatment of ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) , at a recommended daily dose of 90mg .
At the end of the mutual recognition procedure , there was a discrepancy between different European Union ( EU ) Member States regarding the safety of etoricoxib at the 90mg dose in the new proposed indication .
As these concerns were not resolved during the course of the procedure , a notification of an official referral for arbitration under Article 6 ( 12 ) of Commission Regulation EC No 1084 / 2003 to the CHMP was made by France on 19 September 2007 .
The main unresolved areas of concern identified by France were concerns regarding long term safety of a daily dose of 90mg etoricoxib in the view of possible increased cardiovascular ( CV ) risk related to the use of the 90mg dose in the ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) indication .
France considered that a review of the benefit / risk profile of Arcoxia was needed .
The arbitration procedure was discussed by the CHMP at its plenary meeting in September 2007 and a Rapporteur ( Dr .
Karl Broich ) and Co-Rapporteur ( Dr .
Matthew Thatcher ) were appointed .
The referral procedure was initiated on 20 September 2007 with the adoption of a CHMP list of questions that were to be addressed by the marketing authorisation holders ( MAHs ) .
During the February 2008 plenary meeting Dr .
Rafe Survana was appointed Co-Rapporteur , replacing Dr .
Matthew Thatcher .
Written explanations were provided by the MAHs on 14 December 2008 , 5 May 2008 , 12 June 2008 and 20 June 2008 .
The CHMP concluded that the data confirmed the known renovascular safety profile of etoricoxib ( hypertension , oedema and congestive heart failure ) .
The data further confirmed a similar CV thrombotic risk like diclofenac and some degree of upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) safety advantage over naproxen and diclofenac ( though no particular lower GI safety advantage ) . There was little direct comparative safety data for individual non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) other than diclofenac and naproxen . It was therefore difficult to determine risks for etoricoxib compared with ibuprofen , ketoprofen or other less-commonly used NSAIDs . Drug utilisation data showed that some patients with high blood pressure are being initiated on etoricoxib . The CHMP therefore recommended the strengthening of the contraindication in hypertensive patients and alerts prescribers that blood pressure needs to be monitored , especially 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London , E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Healthcare professionals were to be reminded of these measures through a communication letter ( Dear Healthcare Professional Letter ) .
Data from clinical studies showed clinically meaningful treatment effect for the 90mg etoricoxib once daily dose for AS indication ; however , some data are available to indicate that lower doses might also show effect .
The CHMP therefore recommended that dose finding studies should be explored to conclude if treatment with 60mg once daily would also be adequate for some patients .
Based on the review of the available data , the CHMP considered that the benefits of etoricoxib outweigh the risks in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis .
On 26 June 2008 , the CHMP , having considered the data provided by the MAHs , recommended the granting of the variation to the marketing authorisations .
The list of product names concerned is given in Annex I .
The scientific conclusions are provided in Annex II , the amended product information in Annex III and the conditions of the marketing authorisation in Annex IV .
The final opinion was converted into a decision by the European Commission on 9 September 2008 .
∗ Notes : the information given in this document and its annexes reflects only the CHMP opinion dated 26 June 2008 .
The Member States &quot; competent authorities will continue to keep the product under regular review .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
DORIBAX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Doribax ?
Doribax is a medicine containing the active substance doripenem .
It is available as a powder to be made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
What is Doribax used for ?
Doribax is an antibiotic .
It is used to treat the following infections in adults : • nosocomial pneumonia ( an infection of the lungs ) . &apos; Nosocomial &quot; means that the infection was caught in hospital , including pneumonia caused by the use of a ventilator ( a machine that helps a patient to breathe ) ; • complicated infections in the abdomen ( tummy ) . &apos; Complicated &quot; means that the infection is difficult to treat ; • complicated infections of the urinary tract ( the structures that carry urine ) .
Before using Doribax , doctors should consider official guidance on the use of antibiotics .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Doribax used ?
The standard dose of Doribax is 500 mg every eight hours .
Each infusion lasts for one hour , although some patients with pneumonia may need infusions lasting four hours .
Treatment usually continues for between five and 14 days , depending on the type and severity of the infection and the patient &quot; s response .
Because the medicine is removed from the body by the kidneys , the dose of Doribax should be reduced in patients who have moderate or severe problems with their kidneys .
Doribax is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this age group .
How does Doribax work ?
The active substance in Doribax , doripenem , is an antibiotic that belongs to the group &apos; carbapenems . &quot;
It works by attaching to certain types of protein on the surface of the bacteria cells . This prevents the bacteria from building the walls that surround their cells , which kills the bacteria . The list of bacteria against which Doribax is active can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

How has Doribax been studied ?
The effects of Doribax were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Doribax has been studied in five main studies that compared Doribax with other antibiotics : • two studies compared Doribax with piperacillin / tazobactam or imipenem in a total of 979 patients with nosocomial pneumonia ; • two studies compared Doribax with meropenem in a total of 962 patients with complicated infections in the abdomen ; • one study compared Doribax with levofloxacin in 753 patients with complicated urinary tract infections .
In all of the studies , the main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose infection was cured after treatment .
What benefit has Doribax shown during the studies ?
Doribax was as effective as the other antibiotics in treating the infections : • looking at the results of the two studies in nosocomial pneumonia taken together , 75 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 195 out of 260 ) , compared with 72 % of the patients taking piperacillin / tazobactam or imipenem ( 174 out of 241 ) ; • looking at the results of the two studies of complicated abdominal infections taken together , 85 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 275 out of 325 ) , compared with 84 % of the patients receiving meropenem ( 260 out of 309 ) ; • in complicated urinary tract infections , 82 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 230 out of 280 ) , compared with 83 % of the patients receiving levofloxacin ( 221 out of 265 ) .
What is the risk associated with Doribax ?
The most common side effect with Doribax ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is headache .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Doribax , see the Package Leaflet .
Doribax should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to doripenem or to other carbapenems .
It must not be used in patients who are severely allergic to other &apos; beta-lactam &quot; antibiotics , such as penicillins or cephalosporins .
Why has Doribax been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Doribax &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia , complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections in adults .

Questions and answers on the withdrawal of the marketing application for EXULETT
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : dalbavacin
On 9 September 2008 , Pfizer Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for EXULETT , for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria .
What is EXULETT ?
EXULETT is a powder that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance dalbavancin .
What was EXULETT expected to be used for ?
EXULETT was to be used to treat adults with complicated infections of the skin and the &apos; soft tissues &quot; below the skin . &apos; Complicated &quot; means that the infection is difficult to treat , because it has spread to the deep tissues below the skin , treatment with surgery might be needed , or the patient has other conditions that might affect the response to treatment .
EXULETT was to be used only when the infection was known or thought to be caused by types of bacteria that are classified as &apos; Gram-positive &quot; and that would be killed by the medicine .
These bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus ( including &apos; methicillin-resistant &quot; forms known as &apos; MRSA &quot; ) and Streptococcus pyogenes .
How is EXULETT expected to work ?
The active substance in EXULETT , dalbavancin , is an antibiotic that belongs to the group &apos; glycopeptides . &quot;
It is expected to work by stopping the bacteria making their cell walls . This kills the bacteria causing the infection .
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of EXULETT were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company presented the results of one main study that compared the effects of EXULETT with those of linezolid ( another antibiotic ) in 873 adults .
The patients included in this study were required to have complicated skin and soft tissue infections ( such as abscesses or wound infections ) that were due to Gram-positive bacteria .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose infection was treated successfully and who did not need further treatment with any other antibiotics .
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn ?
The application was at day 180 when the company withdrew .
After the CHMP had assessed the responses from the company to a list of questions , there were still some unresolved issues outstanding .
The CHMP normally takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application . Based on the review of the initial documentation , the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120 , which is sent to the company . Once the company has supplied responses to the questions , the CHMP reviews them and may , before giving an opinion , ask any remaining questions at day 180 . Following the CHMP &quot; s opinion , it usually takes around two months for the European Commission to grant a licence . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

What was the recommendation of the CHMP at that time ?
Based on the review of the data and the company &quot; s response to the CHMP list of questions at the time of the withdrawal , the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that EXULETT could not have been approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria .
What were the main concerns of the CHMP ?
The CHMP was concerned that the results of the single main study were too limited to support the approval of the medicine because of the way the study had been carried out , and was of the opinion that another study would be needed to confirm the results .
In addition , the CHMP was concerned over the relevance of the results of the main study , since not all of the patients included in the study seemed to have an infection that was severe enough to need antibiotic treatment given by infusion into a vein .
There were also concerns over whether EXULETT could be manufactured with consistent good quality .
Therefore , at the time of the withdrawal , the CHMP &quot; s view was that a benefit of EXULETT had not been sufficiently demonstrated and any benefits did not outweigh the identified risks .
What were the reasons given by the company to withdraw the application ?
The letter from the company notifying the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here .
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients undergoing clinical trials with EXULETT ?
The company informed the CHMP that there are no consequences for patients currently included in clinical trials of EXULETT .
If you are in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , contact the doctor who is giving it to you .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
INTRODUCTION
Hexavac is a hexavalent vaccine which contains combined antigens derived from Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , Bordetella pertussis , Hepatitis B virus , polio virus and Haemophilus influenzae type b .
This combined vaccine is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of children against the viruses and bacteria mentioned above .
Issues pertaining to the relatively low immunogenicity of the Hepatitis B ( HepB ) component contained in Hexavac have been assessed and extensively discussed by the CHMP and its Working Parties ( Biotechnology Working Party , Vaccines Working Party ) .
On 26 May 2005 , the CHMP agreed on the need to convene an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting on Hepatitis short and long-term protection afforded by recombinant Hepatitis B vaccines .
The CHMP expressed concerns that there is evidence of unpredictable variability in Hepatitis B antibody response following vaccination with Hexavac .
This variability seems to be related to currently uncontrollable variances in the manufacturing process of the recombinant HepB vaccine component .
Concerns were expressed on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac and the potential consequences on long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and boostability post primary course of vaccination with this vaccine .
Between July and September 2005 , the marketing authorisation holder gave oral explanations to the CHMP and its working parties on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in long-term protection against Hepatitis B afforded by Hexavac .
On 14 September 2005 , the European Commission ( EC ) triggered the procedure under Article 18 of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2309 / 93 , as amended , after the CHMP expressed concerns on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac .
The CHMP was requested to give an opinion as to whether the marketing authorisation for Hexavac should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn in the context of an Article 18 of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2309 / 93 , as amended , procedure .
DISCUSSION
The concerns over the immunogenicity of the HepB component increased when lower than expected seroconversion rates were observed following the concomitant administration of Hexavac with other meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines .
These observations led to an intensive investigation programme agreed by the MAH to identify the reason for the lower immune response .
Unpredictable variances to the immunogenicity of the HepB component were investigated by the MAH .
The MAH proposed the development of strategies to identify the source of the problem , as well as to produce a more immunogenic formulation .
Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been investigated by the marketing authorisation holder ( MAH ) , and a modified process step was identified as the most likely strategy to enhance immunogenicity of the HepB component .
Additional concerns were raised by the recent finding that children primary immunised with Hexavac apparently respond to a booster dose of a monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine as a function of the geometric mean titres ( GMTs ) achieved upon completion of the primary immunisation series .
Infants with an initial immune response between 10 and 100 mIU / ml anti HBsAg responded less efficiently or not at all to a single dose of monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine given at the age of 7-9 years , compared to those with initial titres between 100 and 1000 mIU / ml . These findings were based on a rather limited
1 number of infants but raised concerns because the findings of a challenge &apos; weaker &quot; than priming with or without booster dose are unexpected .
On the other hand , there are currently no reports on Hepatitis B breakthrough cases after Hexavac vaccination , considering that the EU is a low endemic region and individual risks would potentially increase only later in life .
Nevertheless , in accordance with the current knowledge , the CHMP considers that childhood Hepatitis B vaccines should be as immunogenic as possible necessitating a maximum of a single booster dose during adolescence to ensure protective efficacy at the time vaccinated subjects might be exposed to a higher risk of infection compared to infancy and childhood .
The MAH reiterated their commitment to establish a test to discriminate batches of Hexavac which have elucidated a good vs. an insufficient immune response during clinical trials .
Furthermore , the MAH has proposed to change the Product Information ( PI ) , namely separate administration of pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines .
Continuous efforts are being made to improve the immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac .
The MAH proposed also to perform additional studies and further develop the Hepatitis B surveillance programme .
Notwithstanding the MAH proposals , the CHMP considered that the applicability of the MAH proposals need to be substantiated by data , which validity needs to be determined .
Furthermore , the proposed amendments to the PI wording were insufficient to adequately address negative consequences on HepB efficacy resulting from variances in the manufacturing process .
CONCLUSION
Overall , the CHMP considered the multifactorial nature of the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in Hexavac .
Reference was made to the highly variable quality of the HepB component contained in Hexavac emerging from a manufacturing production in which the root cause of the low immunogenicity has failed to be identified .
These facts were put into perspective with the clinical consequences observed so far and the apparent low benefits and uncertainties obtained from the Hepatitis B vaccination utilising Hexavac for the target population .
Considering the data on low immunogenicity available today , the CHMP identified a potential risk associated to continued vaccination with Hexavac , in terms of long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and subject boostability post priming with Hexavac .
The CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
The CHMP considered that clinical alternatives exist , i. e. hexavalent vaccines or equivalent combinations of vaccines containing the same components as Hexavac .
Considering all points raised , including time lines required to fully explore all issues related to low HepB immunogenicity following vaccination with Hexavac , the CHMP recommended the suspension for the Marketing Authorisation of Hexavac .
2 GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC
WHEREAS
The CHMP is of the Opinion that Hexavac , can no longer be maintained in normal clinical usage for the following reasons :
• Considering the data on low immunogenicity available today , the CHMP identified a potential risk associated to continued vaccination with Hexavac , in terms of long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and subject boostability post priming with Hexavac .
• The CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
• The CHMP considered that the benefit / risk balance of Hexavac for primary and booster vaccination of children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , Hepatitis B caused by all known subtypes of viruses , poliomyelitis and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b , was not favourable .
The CHMP has recommended the suspension of the Marketing Authorisations for Hexavac .

Questions and answers on the referral for Implanon subdermal implant etonogestrel 68 mg
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed an arbitration procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Implanon .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Implanon outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation granted in the Netherlands can be recognised in other Member States of the European Union .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Implanon ?
Implanon is a female contraceptive .
It is presented as a small rod that is implanted by a doctor or a nurse using a special applicator just under the skin of the upper arm .
The active substance in Implanon , etonogestrel , is a synthetic female hormone resembling progesterone .
Once implanted , the rod releases a small amount of etonogestrel continuously into the bloodstream .
This changes the body &quot; s hormonal balance and help to prevent ovulation .
Implanon can protect for up to three years ; at the end of this period the implant must be removed .
Why was Implanon reviewed ?
N. V .
Organon submitted Implanon for a second renewal of the marketing authorisation through mutual recognition on the basis of the initial authorisation granted by the Netherlands on 25 August 1998 .
The company wanted the renewal of authorisation to be recognised in all the EU Member States , as well as Norway and Iceland where the product is already authorised .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 6 October 2008 , the Dutch regulatory agency referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns regarding the side effects related to insertion and removal of the implant , the risk of breast cancer , the incidence of irregular bleedings leading to premature removal of the implant .
Additionally , the data on effectiveness in obese women in particular in the third year of use was considered insufficient .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
Based on the evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Implanon outweigh its risks , and therefore the renewal of the marketing authorisation for Implanon should be granted in all concerned member states .
The CHMP also endorsed the changes to the product information for the medicine as agreed by the Coordination Group for the Mutual and Decentralised Procedures .
The European Commission issued a decision on 6 February 2009 .

Common Name :
Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide ( polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ) conjugated to tetanus toxoid and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C ( MenC ) polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Menitorix , 5 micrograms PRP with 12,5 micrograms TT , 5 micrograms PSC with 5 micrograms TT in the form of Powder and Solvent for Solution for Injection is a vaccine , indicated for the prevention of invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) and Neisseria meningitidis group C ( MenC ) in infants from the age of 2 months and children up to the age of 2 years .
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals submitted applications for mutual recognition of Menitorix , 5 micrograms PRP with 12,5 micrograms TT , 5 micrograms PSC with 5 micrograms TT in the form of powder and solvent for solution for injection , on the basis of the marketing authorisation granted by the United Kingdom on 19 December 2005 .
The Mutual Recognition Procedure started on 17 October 2006 .
The Reference Member State was the United Kingdom and the Concerned Member States were Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Poland and Spain .
These Member States were not able to reach an agreement in respect of the Mutual Recognition of the Marketing Authorisation granted by the Reference Member State .
The United Kingdom referred the reasons for disagreement to the EMEA on 29 March 2007 .
Public health objections were raised because no immunological correlates of protection were established for MenC conjugates and because the submission of data on pre-licensure effectiveness were required to cover infant and toddler use .
Furthermore , it could not be accepted that no data on the use of Menitorix or on antibody persistence beyond the second year of life was provided .
These objections were considered to be of serious public health concern .
The arbitration procedure started on 26 April 2007 with the adoption of a list of questions .
The Rapporteur was Dr Ian Hudson and Co-Rapporteur was Dr Michał Piroż ynski .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided written explanations on 19 July 2007 and on 17 October 2007 .
During their November 2007 meeting , the CHMP , in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee , was of the opinion that the benefit / risk ratio is favourable for Menitorix , that the objections raised by Greece , Poland and Spain should not prevent the granting of a Marketing Authorisation and that the Summary of Product Characteristics , labelling and package leaflet of the Reference Member State should be amended .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE ( CHMP ) OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 31 REFERRAL
Norfloxacin containing medicinal products
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : norfloxacin
BACKGROUND INFORMATION *
Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum , quinolone bactericidal agent indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic complicated or uncomplicated pyelonephritis due to susceptible organisms .
On 14 September 2007 , Belgium referred the matter to the EMEA under Article 31 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC and asked the CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for oral formulations of medicinal products containing norfloxacin in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated or uncomplicated pyelonephritis should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn across the European Union following the re-assessment of norfloxacin benefit / risk balance .
This request was based on the following reasons :
- Pyelonephritis is often associated with bacteraemia .
Norfloxacin containing medicinal products ,
which are only available as an oral formulation , do not provide adequate serum levels for the treatment of concomitant bacteraemia .
- There are other alternative treatments available for the above-mentioned indication . Second
generation fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin , ofloxacin and levofloxacin show higher serum concentrations and a much better tissue distribution than norfloxacin .
- Complicated pyelonephritis can be treated orally or intravenously ( according to local treatment
policy and diagnostic criteria used for defining complicated infection ) .
In case of oral treatment , second generation fluoroquinolones are superior to norfloxacin because they present higher serum and tissue levels .
The same objections are obviously valid for the oral treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis .
The referral procedure started on 20 September 2007 .
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed were :
Dr .
Ondř ej Slanař and Dr .
Pieter Neels , respectively .
Written explanations were provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder by 25 February and 20 June 2008 .
Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the Rapporteurs &quot; assessment reports , the CHMP concluded that for oral formulations of norfloxacin containing medicinal products the benefit does not outweigh the risk in acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis , and therefore adopted an opinion on 24 July 2008 recommending the variation of the Marketing Authorisations by removing the therapeutic indication &quot; acute and chronic complicated pyelonephritis &quot; from the Product Information for the norfloxacin containing medicinal products taken orally .
The list of product names concerned is given in the Annex I. The scientific conclusions are provided in the Annex II .
* Notes : The information given in this document and Annexes reflect only the CHMP Opinion dated 24 July 2008 .
The Member States competent authorities will continue to keep the product under regular review .

Questions and answers on the referral for Sabumalin salbutamol , metered dose aerosol inhaler , 100 μ g / dose
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Sabumalin .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Sabumalin outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation can be granted in Sweden as well as in the following Member States of the European Union : Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovenia , Spain and the United Kingdom .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Sabumalin ?
Sabumalin is a medicine in a pressurised inhaler that contains salbutamol as active substance .
Salbutamol is a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist .
This means that salbutamol activates the beta2- receptors in the body .
When given by inhalation as in Sabumalin , salbutamol directly activates the beta2-receptors in the respiratory system .
This makes the airways widen , allowing the air to flow more freely .
Sabumalin is used to treat the breathing difficulties caused by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
It can also be used to prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise or other triggering factors , such as house dust , pollen , cats , dogs and cigarette smoke .
Sabumalin is used to relieve symptoms , and its use should not delay the use of inhaled steroids .
Sabumalin is a &apos; generic medicine . &quot;
This means that Sabumalin is similar to a &apos; reference medicine &quot; already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) called Sultanol inhaler .
Why was Sabumalin reviewed ?
Hexal AG submitted Sabumalin to the Swedish medicines regulatory agency for a decentralised procedure on 5 December 2006 .
This is a procedure when one Member State ( the &apos; reference Member State , &quot; in this instance Sweden ) assesses a medicine with a view of granting a marketing authorisation that will be valid in this country as well as in other member states ( the &apos; concerned Member States , &quot; in this instance Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovenia , Spain and the United Kingdom ) .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 4 March 2008 , the Swedish medicines regulatory agency referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns regarding that there was not enough data showing that Sabumalin is equivalent to the reference medicine .
Concerns were also raised regarding how to store the inhaler and the effect of the orientation of the inhaler on the delivery of the medicine .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ? Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Sabumalin outweigh its risks , and that therefore the marketing authorisation for Sabumalin should be granted in all concerned member states .

Questions and answers on the referral for Sanohex salbutamol , metered dose aerosol inhaler , 100 μ g / dose
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Sanohex .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Sanohex outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation can be granted in Sweden as well as in the following Member States of the European Union : Austria , Germany , Ireland and Spain .

Questions and answers on the referral for Uman Big Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulins , 180 IU / ml , solution for injection
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Uman Big 180 IU / ml , solution for injection .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Uman Big outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation granted in Italy can be recognised in other Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Uman Big ?
Uman Big is a solution of human hepatitis B immunoglobulins .
Immunoglobulins are blood proteins that have been extracted from donor plasma .
Hepatitis B immunoglobulins contain high levels of antibodies against the hepatitis B virus .
Uman Big is given as an intramuscular ( into the muscle ) injection to prevent hepatitis B in the following cases : • in case of accidental exposure in people who have not been vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus ; including those whose vaccination is incomplete or status unknown ; • in haemodialysed patients ( patients whose kidneys have failed and who rely on a blood purification technique called haemodialysis ) , until vaccination has become effective ; • in the newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother ; • in subjects who did not show an immune response after vaccination ( and for whom a continuous prevention is necessary due to the continuous risk of being infected with hepatitis B .
Why was Uman Big reviewed ?
Kedrion S. p . A. submitted Uman Big for mutual recognition on the basis of the initial authorisation granted by Italy on 2 June 1979 .
The company wanted the authorisation to be recognised in Austria , Denmark , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Poland , Portugal and Sweden ( the concerned Member States ) .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 31 October 2008 , the Italian medicines agency , Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco , referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns over the insufficiency of the clinical data submitted to establish the efficacy of the product .
In addition , the absence of product specific safety data or post- marketing safety data was raised as a concern .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee and at the CHMP &quot; s Blood Products Working Party , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Uman Big outweigh its risks , and that therefore the marketing authorisation for Uman Big should be granted in all concerned member states .
The European Commission issued a decision on 06 March 2009 .

What is Fevaxyn Pentofel ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel is a vaccine for cats which is a solution for injection in a prefilled syringe .
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains the following inactivated viruses : Feline Panleukopenia Virus , Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus , Feline Calicivirus , Feline Leukaemia Virus , and the inactivated bacterium Feline Chlamydia psittaci .
What is Fevaxyn Pentofel used for ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel is used to immunise healthy cats of 9 weeks or older against Feline Panleukopenia and Feline Leukaemia and against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci .
The contents of the prefilled syringe are shaken and given by subcutaneous ( under the skin ) injection .
For cats 9 weeks and older , two doses are given at an interval of 3 to 4 weeks .
An additional dose is recommended for kittens living in high-risk areas for Feline Leukaemia Virus whose first dose was administered before 12 weeks of age .
Fevaxyn Pentofel is then given once every year .
How does Fevaxyn Pentofel work ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains small amounts of four inactivated viruses and one inactivated bacterium .
When injected , this small exposure helps the cat &quot; s immune system to recognise and attack the viruses and bacterium .
When exposed to any of these viruses and bacterium later in life , the cat will either not become infected or will have a much less serious infection .
How has the effectiveness of Fevaxyn Pentofel been studied ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel has been studied against Feline Leukaemia , against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci , as well as against disease caused by Feline Panleukopenia virus . In addition , studies in cats of various breeds were carried out to observe any side effects of Fevaxyn Pentofel after the first and second vaccinations .

What is ProMeris ?
ProMeris is a clear yellow to amber solution that contains metaflumizone as active substance .
It is given to cats with a pre-filled spot-on pipette , a small plastic container which is already filled with the correct amount of ProMeris needed to treat one cat ( ProMeris is available in 2 different sizes for various cat weights ) .
The content of the pipette is squeezed onto the skin after parting the fur between the shoulder blades of the cat .
What is ProMeris used for ?
ProMeris is an &quot; ectoparasiticide , &quot; this means that it will kill parasites that live on the skin or in the fur of animals , such as fleas and ticks .
ProMeris is used to treat and to prevent flea infestations in cats .
It can also be used as part of a treatment strategy for the control of Flea Allergy Dermatitis , an allergic reaction of cats to flea bites .
Once applied , it remains active for up to 6 weeks .
How does ProMeris work ?
The active substance of ProMeris , metaflumizone , interferes with the neural activity of the fleas and consequently leads to the death of these parasites . How has ProMeris been studied ? Data were provided on the pharmaceutical quality , the safety of the product in cats and the safety in humans ( people in contact with the product ) and the environment . The effectiveness of metaflumizone against flea infestations in cats was investigated in laboratory studies and in a field trial .

Cats from various breeds ( mainly European shorthair ) , age groups and weight that were infested with fleas were either treated with ProMeris or with other products authorised in the EU for this indication .
The effectiveness was measured looking at the number of fleas on the cat at various times up to 2 months after application .
What benefit has ProMeris shown during the studies ?
The results of the field trial showed that ProMeris is effective in the treatment and prevention of flea infestations in cats .
The medicine killed fleas within 24 hours after treatment and its effectiveness lasted 6 weeks .
What is the risk associated with ProMeris ?
There may be a change in appearance of the fur ( oily appearance and clumping or spiking of hair ) at the application site .
If a cat licks the application area , the cat might salivate considerably for a short period .
ProMeris should not be used in cats less than 8 weeks old since it has not been sufficiently studied in these animals .
As other products of this group , ProMeris should not be used in sick animals or cats that have just recovered from illness .
This product is specifically developed for cats and should not be used in any other animal species .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
As a precautionary measure , direct contact with the treated cat should be avoided and children should not be allowed to play with a treated animal until the application site is dry .
Recently treated animals should not be allowed to sleep in the same bed as their owners , especially children .
Skin contact with the pipette content should be avoided .
Skin should be washed and eyes should be rinsed with water , if accidental exposure occurred .
When administering ProMeris , the user should not smoke , eat or drink .
Why has ProMeris been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of ProMeris exceed the risks for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations in cats . The Committee recommended that ProMeris be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

What is Rheumocam ?
Rheumocam is a yellowish opaque oral suspension which is to be given mixed with food .
Rheumocam contains the active substance meloxicam in a strength of 1.5 mg / ml .
Rheumocam is a &apos; generic &quot; which means that Rheumocam is similar to a &apos; reference veterinary medicine &quot; already authorised in the EU ( Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension ) .
Studies have been carried out to prove that Rheumocam is &apos; bioequivalent &quot; to the reference veterinary medicine which means that Rheumocam is equivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml suspension in the way it is absorbed and used by the body .
What is Rheumocam used for ?
Rheumocam is used in dogs to relieve inflammation and pain in musculo-skeletal disorders .
It can be used for both acute disorders , such as those seen after an injury , and chronic ( long term ) disorders .
Rheumocam is given to the dog once a day , with food , at the dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam / kg body weight on the first day , then at 0.1 mg / kg afterwards .
The amount of suspension to be used is measured using a special dosing syringe ( provided in the product package ) and poured on the food .
How does Rheumocam work ?
Rheumocam contains meloxicam , which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Meloxicam acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .
As the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation , pain , exudation and fever , meloxicam reduces those responses . How has the effectiveness of Rheumocam been studied ? A study looked at how Rheumocam was absorbed and its effects in the body , in comparison with Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged What are the side-effects of Rheumocam ?
Occasional side effects of Rheumocam are those seen with NSAIDs , such as loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea , blood appearing in the stools and apathy ( lack of vitality ) .
These side effects occur generally within the first week of treatment and are usually temporary and disappear once treatment has stopped .
In very rare cases they may be serious or fatal .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
People who are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to NSAIDs should avoid contact with Rheumocam .
If the product is swallowed by a person , the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately .
Why has Rheumocam been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) considered that , in accordance with European Union requirements , Rheumocam has been shown to be bioequivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension .
Therefore the CVMP &quot; s view was that , as for Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension , Rheumocam &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks when treating inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs and they recommended that Rheumocam should be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

INGELVAC CIRCOFLEX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report . Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
If you need more information about your animal &quot; s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Ingelvac CircoFLEX ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is a vaccine for use in pigs , which is available as a suspension for injection .
It contains a protein ( antigen ) from the porcine circovirus type 2 virus ( PCV2 ) .
The vaccine does not contain any live PCV2 and the antigen cannot replicate in the animal .
What is Ingelvac CircoFLEX used for ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is used to vaccinate pigs from two weeks of age against PCV2 infection .
This helps to reduce deaths , signs of disease such as weight loss , and damage to lymphoid tissue associated with this infection .
It can also reduce shedding of the virus from the nose , the level of the virus in the blood and lymphoid tissue , and the duration of blood infection ( viraemia ) with the virus .
The vaccine is given by injection into a muscle .
Onset of protection against PCV2 occurs from as early as two weeks after the injection and lasts for at least 17 weeks .
How does Ingelvac CircoFLEX work ?
Porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) is known to cause a wide variety of clinical signs and syndromes in pigs , some of which may be caused by PCV2 in combination with other agents .
PCV2 associated infections may include symptoms such as weight loss or failure to grow , enlarged lymph nodes , difficulty breathing , diarrhoea , pale skin and jaundice ( yellowing of the skin ) .
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is a vaccine .
Vaccines work by &apos; teaching &quot; the immune system ( the body &quot; s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease .
Ingelvac CircoFLEX contains small amounts of a protein from PCV2 .
When a pig is given the vaccine , the pig &quot; s immune system recognises the protein as &apos; foreign &quot; and reacts by building up an active immune response .
In the future , the immune system will be able to react against the virus more quickly when it is exposed to the virus .
This active immune response will help to protect the pig against the disease caused by this virus .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged How has Ingelvac CircoFLEX been studied ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX has been studied in a number of trials involving pigs of various breeds .
These studies have been performed under laboratory as well as under typical European farming conditions .
The main measure of effectiveness was the rate of weight gain in the vaccinated pigs , but the studies also looked at other parameters including symptoms , the level of PCV2 in the blood and the number of runts .
What benefit has Ingelvac CircoFLEX shown during the studies ?
The trials showed that vaccination of pigs with Ingelvac CircoFLEX reduced weight loss in the piglets .
It also reduced the levels of PCV2 in the blood , symptoms of PCV2 infection , the number of runts and death rates .
What is the risk associated with Ingelvac CircoFLEX ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX can cause a mild , temporary increase in body temperature , usually on the day of vaccination .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
There are no special precautions for the person who gives Ingelvac CircoFLEX or comes into contact with the animal .
What is the time allowed before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
The withdrawal period is zero days .
Why has Ingelvac CircoFLEX been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Ingelvac CircoFLEX exceed the risks for the active immunisation of pigs , over the age of two weeks , against PCV2 , and recommended that Ingelvac CircoFLEX be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

What is Duvaxyn WNV ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine containing an inactivated West Nile virus ( inactivated means that the virus has been killed so that it cannot cause the disease any more ) .
What is Duvaxyn WNV used for ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine used in horses to protect against West Nile virus disease .
The vaccine reduces the number of viraemic horses ( these are horses with virus circulating in their blood stream ) The vaccine is injected intramuscularly ( into a muscle ) in the neck of the horse .
How does Duvaxyn WNV work ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine .
When it is given to horses , the animal &quot; s immune system ( their natural defence mechanism ) learns how to make antibodies ( a special type of protein ) to fight the disease .
In the future , if the horses are exposed to the West Nile virus , the immune system will be able to make those antibodies quicker and this will help them fight the disease .
How has Duvaxyn WNV been studied ?
The company carried out laboratory safety studies in both young foals ( 6 months of age ) and pregnant mares using the vaccine .
These showed the safety of the use of the vaccine in horses in general and in young ( 6 months of age or older ) and pregnant animals in particular .
They then performed a number of field trials which further confirmed the safety of Duvaxyn WNV and proved its efficacy in reducing the number of viraemic horses and thereby protecting against the disease .
