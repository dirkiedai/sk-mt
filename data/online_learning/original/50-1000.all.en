1 .
Introduction and background
Germany , reference member state in the decentralised procedure , notified the EMEA on 21 December 2008 that the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Veterinary ( CMD ( v ) ) failed to reach an agreement for Compagel gel for horses .
Pursuant to Article 33 ( 4 ) of Council Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , the matter was referred to the CVMP .
France and Sweden consider that due to the absence of efficacy documentation it cannot be assumed that the product is efficacious and that this as such presents a potential serious risk to animal health .
CVMP noted that Compagel gel for horses is a generic of Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) and that the concerns raised by France and Sweden can only be addressed in the framework of this procedure , in case any differences between the two products would justify different conclusions on the safety or efficacy .
CVMP started the procedure on 16 January 2008 .
A list of questions was adopted the same day and sent to the applicant , by which the procedure clock was stopped .
On 22 January 2008 responses to the questions were received from applicant and the clock restarted .
The aim of the assessment is to establish whether marketing authorisations of veterinary medicinal products included in the referral procedure should be maintained , suspended , varied or revoked with view to the grounds for referral .
2 .
Discussion
The applicant was requested to provide the following information :
A copy of the information and documents referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 32 ( 1 ) of the Directive and any additional information provided to the Reference Member State during the 60 day CMD ( v ) procedure ( rapporteurs and EMEA only ) .
In view of the concerns raised by France and Sweden , to indicate and to substantiate where necessary , any differences between Compagel gel for horses and reference product Tensolvet 50000 ( authorised in Germany ) that could justify different conclusions on the efficacy for the two products .
In response to question 1 , the applicant provided a copy of the original dossier as submitted in support of the application of a mutual recognition procedure , and any supplementary data submitted during the mutual recognition procedure and the referral procedure in CMD ( v ) thereafter .
The application of Compagel gel for horses was based upon Art. 13 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended , in which it is stated that &quot; By way of derogation from point ( j ) of the first subparagraph of Article 12 ( 3 ) , and without prejudice to the law relating to the protection of industrial and commercial property , the applicant shall not be required to provide the results of the safety and residue tests or of the preclinical and clinical trials if he can demonstrate that the medicinal product is a generic of a reference medicinal product which is or has been authorized under Article 5 for not less than eight years in a Member State or the Community . &quot;
Reference is made to the reference product Tensolvet 50000 which has been registered and used over a period of more than eight years in Germany .
All concerned member states in the mutual recognition procedure agreed that Compagel gel for horses is essentially similar to Tensolvet 50000 .
In response to question 2 , the applicant responded that there are no differences at all that would justify different conclusions on the safety and efficacy for the two products .
4 / 7 Under these conditions the applicant is exempted from submitting further preclinical or clinical data on efficacy of the proposed product , and can claim the same indications for use as for the reference product Tensolvet 50000 .
3 .
Conclusions and Recommendations
Compagel gel for horses proved to be essentially similar to the reference product , Tensolvet 50000 .
Consequently , the same conclusions on efficacy and safety apply to both products .
The objections raised by France and Sweden should not prevent the granting of a marketing authorisation for Compagel gel for horses .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR VETERINARY USE ( CVMP )
OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 33 ( 4 ) REFERRAL FOR DOXYPREX 100mg PREMIX
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Doxyprex 100 mg premix presented in 5 kg , 20 kg and 25 kg bags containing 100 mg / g doxycycline base as hyclate .
The product is authorised with the indication the treatment of swine respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella multocida , Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae .
In December 2005 , a Mutual Recognition Procedure ( MRP ) started with Spain acting as Reference Member State and ten Concerned Member States .
Germany could not agree to the granting a marketing authorisation and the matter was referred to the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures , CMD ( v ) , and subsequently to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) .
Germany considered that the product could represent a potential serious risk to animal health on the grounds that the efficacy had not been sufficiently substantiated .
The CVMP during its meeting of 21-22 June 2006 started a referral procedure under Article 33 ( 4 ) of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , for Doxyprex 100 mg premix .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder ( MAH ) was requested to substantiate the efficacy of the product .
The applicant provided a justification for submission of this application on a &quot; well-established use &quot; basis .
Within the EU doxycycline-based premix products for pigs at recommended dose rates of 10mg / kg once daily for 5 days are stated as having been authorised since 1985 .
Similar products with 8 or 10 days treatment durations are also available within the EU .
Annex I of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC as amended by directive 2004 / 28 / EC notes that post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue .
Therefore , the CVMP considered that the reports mentioned above give favourable evidence for the safety and efficacy of doxycycline in general , but also for the specific final formulation as marketed in Spain .
The applicant submitted a scientific report on Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex ( PRDC ) . In the pivotal clinical trial , the presence of P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica was clearly demonstrated in sick pigs , however , no post treatment sampling was done to show bacteriological cure .
The applicant justifies that the presence of M. hyopneumoniae was not determined by bacteriological methods because it was difficult to isolate at that time . The presence was assumed . The applicant provided evidence of efficacy of the active substance , doxycycline , against M. hyopneumoniae in pigs from published literature and from MIC studies . These are all references provided with the original submission . However , the CVMP considered that the fact that no post treatment bacteriological samples were taken mean that bacteriological cure cannot be assumed or claimed . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London , E14 4HB , UK Tel .

The CVMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation to Doxyprex 100 mg / g Premix for medicated feeding stuff for pigs for the following indication because a positive benefit / risk analysis has been demonstrated and no potential serious risk has been identified .
&quot; For the treatment and prevention of porcine respiratory disease , caused by Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica , susceptible to doxycycline , when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd . &quot;
A benefit-risk analysis could not be conducted due to the lack of pivotal evidence on clinical efficacy for the indication M. hyopneumoniae .
Therefore , the recommendation is to remove this pathogen from the indications .
The CVMP Opinion was adopted on 14 February 2007 and the subsequent Commission Decision on 22 May 2007 .

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MARKETING APPLICATION for RIQUENT
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : abetimus
On 13 October 2006 , La Jolla Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Riquent , for the treatment of lupus nephritis .
What is Riquent ?
Riquent is a solution for injection that contains 50 mg / ml of the active substance abetimus .
What was Riquent expected to be used for ?
Riquent was expected to be used to treat lupus nephritis , an inflammation of the kidneys in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE , an auto-immune disease caused by the body &quot; s own defence system attacking normal tissue ) who have a history of kidney disease and have been tested to check that they will benefit from the medicine .
Riquent was expected to delay and to reduce the incidence of &apos; flares &quot; ( increased signs of kidney disease ) .
Because the number of patients with lupus nephritis is low , the disease is rare , and Riquent was designated an orphan medicine ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) on 20 November 2001 .
How is Riquent expected to work ?
Abetimus , the active substance in Riquent , is a selective immunosuppressive agent ( a compound that selectively dampens down the immune system ) .
Most patients with SLE have antibodies in their blood that are directed against double-stranded DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) .
These antibodies are thought to be linked to the development of lupus kidney disease .
Abetimus is a small piece of double-stranded DNA that has been designed to reduce circulating levels of these antibodies .
When Riquent is injected , the levels of these antibodies in the blood are lowered and this is expected to help reduce the patient &quot; s likelihood of experiencing a &apos; flare . &quot;
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of Riquent were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
There were two main studies involving a total of 529 patients with SLE , in which Riquent was compared with a placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The studies measured how many patients developed &apos; flares &quot; and the time to the development of the flares by measuring the levels of protein in the urine and of creatinine ( an enzyme that is a marker of kidney function ) in the blood .
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn ?
The application was at day 114 when the company withdrew .
The CHMP was evaluating the initial documentation provided by the company .
The CHMP normally takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application .
Based on the review of the initial documentation , the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120 , which is sent to the company .

The CHMP was evaluating the initial documentation provided by the Company and had not yet made any recommendations .
What were the reasons given by the company to withdraw the application ?
The letter from the company notifying the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here .
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients undergoing clinical trials / compassionate use programmes with Riquent ?
The company informed the CHMP that it plans to continue the ongoing clinical trials in the treatment of lupus nephritis .
The Company has no compassionate use programme .
A compassionate use programme is a programme through which doctors can request a medicine for a specific disease for one of their patients before the medicine is fully authorised .
If you are in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , contact the doctor who is giving it to you .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE ( CHMP ) OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 6 ( 12 ) REFERRAL
Arcoxia
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : etoricoxib
BACKGROUND INFORMATION *
Etoricoxib is a selective inhibitor of COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ) indicated in the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis ( OA , 30-60mg once daily ( od ) ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA , 90mg od ) and the pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis ( 120mg od ) .
This referral procedure relates to a request for arbitration concerning a type II variation for a new indication to include treatment of ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) , at a recommended daily dose of 90mg .
At the end of the mutual recognition procedure , there was a discrepancy between different European Union ( EU ) Member States regarding the safety of etoricoxib at the 90mg dose in the new proposed indication .
As these concerns were not resolved during the course of the procedure , a notification of an official referral for arbitration under Article 6 ( 12 ) of Commission Regulation EC No 1084 / 2003 to the CHMP was made by France on 19 September 2007 .
The main unresolved areas of concern identified by France were concerns regarding long term safety of a daily dose of 90mg etoricoxib in the view of possible increased cardiovascular ( CV ) risk related to the use of the 90mg dose in the ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) indication .
France considered that a review of the benefit / risk profile of Arcoxia was needed .
The arbitration procedure was discussed by the CHMP at its plenary meeting in September 2007 and a Rapporteur ( Dr .
Karl Broich ) and Co-Rapporteur ( Dr .
Matthew Thatcher ) were appointed .
The referral procedure was initiated on 20 September 2007 with the adoption of a CHMP list of questions that were to be addressed by the marketing authorisation holders ( MAHs ) .
During the February 2008 plenary meeting Dr .
Rafe Survana was appointed Co-Rapporteur , replacing Dr .
Matthew Thatcher .
Written explanations were provided by the MAHs on 14 December 2008 , 5 May 2008 , 12 June 2008 and 20 June 2008 .
The CHMP concluded that the data confirmed the known renovascular safety profile of etoricoxib ( hypertension , oedema and congestive heart failure ) .
The data further confirmed a similar CV thrombotic risk like diclofenac and some degree of upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) safety advantage over naproxen and diclofenac ( though no particular lower GI safety advantage ) . There was little direct comparative safety data for individual non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) other than diclofenac and naproxen . It was therefore difficult to determine risks for etoricoxib compared with ibuprofen , ketoprofen or other less-commonly used NSAIDs . Drug utilisation data showed that some patients with high blood pressure are being initiated on etoricoxib . The CHMP therefore recommended the strengthening of the contraindication in hypertensive patients and alerts prescribers that blood pressure needs to be monitored , especially 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London , E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Healthcare professionals were to be reminded of these measures through a communication letter ( Dear Healthcare Professional Letter ) .
Data from clinical studies showed clinically meaningful treatment effect for the 90mg etoricoxib once daily dose for AS indication ; however , some data are available to indicate that lower doses might also show effect .
The CHMP therefore recommended that dose finding studies should be explored to conclude if treatment with 60mg once daily would also be adequate for some patients .
Based on the review of the available data , the CHMP considered that the benefits of etoricoxib outweigh the risks in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis .
On 26 June 2008 , the CHMP , having considered the data provided by the MAHs , recommended the granting of the variation to the marketing authorisations .
The list of product names concerned is given in Annex I .
The scientific conclusions are provided in Annex II , the amended product information in Annex III and the conditions of the marketing authorisation in Annex IV .
The final opinion was converted into a decision by the European Commission on 9 September 2008 .
∗ Notes : the information given in this document and its annexes reflects only the CHMP opinion dated 26 June 2008 .
The Member States &quot; competent authorities will continue to keep the product under regular review .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
DORIBAX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Doribax ?
Doribax is a medicine containing the active substance doripenem .
It is available as a powder to be made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
What is Doribax used for ?
Doribax is an antibiotic .
It is used to treat the following infections in adults : • nosocomial pneumonia ( an infection of the lungs ) . &apos; Nosocomial &quot; means that the infection was caught in hospital , including pneumonia caused by the use of a ventilator ( a machine that helps a patient to breathe ) ; • complicated infections in the abdomen ( tummy ) . &apos; Complicated &quot; means that the infection is difficult to treat ; • complicated infections of the urinary tract ( the structures that carry urine ) .
Before using Doribax , doctors should consider official guidance on the use of antibiotics .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Doribax used ?
The standard dose of Doribax is 500 mg every eight hours .
Each infusion lasts for one hour , although some patients with pneumonia may need infusions lasting four hours .
Treatment usually continues for between five and 14 days , depending on the type and severity of the infection and the patient &quot; s response .
Because the medicine is removed from the body by the kidneys , the dose of Doribax should be reduced in patients who have moderate or severe problems with their kidneys .
Doribax is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this age group .
How does Doribax work ?
The active substance in Doribax , doripenem , is an antibiotic that belongs to the group &apos; carbapenems . &quot;
It works by attaching to certain types of protein on the surface of the bacteria cells . This prevents the bacteria from building the walls that surround their cells , which kills the bacteria . The list of bacteria against which Doribax is active can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

How has Doribax been studied ?
The effects of Doribax were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Doribax has been studied in five main studies that compared Doribax with other antibiotics : • two studies compared Doribax with piperacillin / tazobactam or imipenem in a total of 979 patients with nosocomial pneumonia ; • two studies compared Doribax with meropenem in a total of 962 patients with complicated infections in the abdomen ; • one study compared Doribax with levofloxacin in 753 patients with complicated urinary tract infections .
In all of the studies , the main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose infection was cured after treatment .
What benefit has Doribax shown during the studies ?
Doribax was as effective as the other antibiotics in treating the infections : • looking at the results of the two studies in nosocomial pneumonia taken together , 75 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 195 out of 260 ) , compared with 72 % of the patients taking piperacillin / tazobactam or imipenem ( 174 out of 241 ) ; • looking at the results of the two studies of complicated abdominal infections taken together , 85 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 275 out of 325 ) , compared with 84 % of the patients receiving meropenem ( 260 out of 309 ) ; • in complicated urinary tract infections , 82 % of the patients receiving Doribax were cured ( 230 out of 280 ) , compared with 83 % of the patients receiving levofloxacin ( 221 out of 265 ) .
What is the risk associated with Doribax ?
The most common side effect with Doribax ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is headache .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Doribax , see the Package Leaflet .
Doribax should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to doripenem or to other carbapenems .
It must not be used in patients who are severely allergic to other &apos; beta-lactam &quot; antibiotics , such as penicillins or cephalosporins .
Why has Doribax been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Doribax &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia , complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections in adults .

Questions and answers on the withdrawal of the marketing application for EXULETT
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : dalbavacin
On 9 September 2008 , Pfizer Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for EXULETT , for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria .
What is EXULETT ?
EXULETT is a powder that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance dalbavancin .
What was EXULETT expected to be used for ?
EXULETT was to be used to treat adults with complicated infections of the skin and the &apos; soft tissues &quot; below the skin . &apos; Complicated &quot; means that the infection is difficult to treat , because it has spread to the deep tissues below the skin , treatment with surgery might be needed , or the patient has other conditions that might affect the response to treatment .
EXULETT was to be used only when the infection was known or thought to be caused by types of bacteria that are classified as &apos; Gram-positive &quot; and that would be killed by the medicine .
These bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus ( including &apos; methicillin-resistant &quot; forms known as &apos; MRSA &quot; ) and Streptococcus pyogenes .
How is EXULETT expected to work ?
The active substance in EXULETT , dalbavancin , is an antibiotic that belongs to the group &apos; glycopeptides . &quot;
It is expected to work by stopping the bacteria making their cell walls . This kills the bacteria causing the infection .
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of EXULETT were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company presented the results of one main study that compared the effects of EXULETT with those of linezolid ( another antibiotic ) in 873 adults .
The patients included in this study were required to have complicated skin and soft tissue infections ( such as abscesses or wound infections ) that were due to Gram-positive bacteria .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose infection was treated successfully and who did not need further treatment with any other antibiotics .
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn ?
The application was at day 180 when the company withdrew .
After the CHMP had assessed the responses from the company to a list of questions , there were still some unresolved issues outstanding .
The CHMP normally takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application . Based on the review of the initial documentation , the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120 , which is sent to the company . Once the company has supplied responses to the questions , the CHMP reviews them and may , before giving an opinion , ask any remaining questions at day 180 . Following the CHMP &quot; s opinion , it usually takes around two months for the European Commission to grant a licence . 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

What was the recommendation of the CHMP at that time ?
Based on the review of the data and the company &quot; s response to the CHMP list of questions at the time of the withdrawal , the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that EXULETT could not have been approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria .
What were the main concerns of the CHMP ?
The CHMP was concerned that the results of the single main study were too limited to support the approval of the medicine because of the way the study had been carried out , and was of the opinion that another study would be needed to confirm the results .
In addition , the CHMP was concerned over the relevance of the results of the main study , since not all of the patients included in the study seemed to have an infection that was severe enough to need antibiotic treatment given by infusion into a vein .
There were also concerns over whether EXULETT could be manufactured with consistent good quality .
Therefore , at the time of the withdrawal , the CHMP &quot; s view was that a benefit of EXULETT had not been sufficiently demonstrated and any benefits did not outweigh the identified risks .
What were the reasons given by the company to withdraw the application ?
The letter from the company notifying the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here .
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients undergoing clinical trials with EXULETT ?
The company informed the CHMP that there are no consequences for patients currently included in clinical trials of EXULETT .
If you are in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , contact the doctor who is giving it to you .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
INTRODUCTION
Hexavac is a hexavalent vaccine which contains combined antigens derived from Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , Bordetella pertussis , Hepatitis B virus , polio virus and Haemophilus influenzae type b .
This combined vaccine is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of children against the viruses and bacteria mentioned above .
Issues pertaining to the relatively low immunogenicity of the Hepatitis B ( HepB ) component contained in Hexavac have been assessed and extensively discussed by the CHMP and its Working Parties ( Biotechnology Working Party , Vaccines Working Party ) .
On 26 May 2005 , the CHMP agreed on the need to convene an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting on Hepatitis short and long-term protection afforded by recombinant Hepatitis B vaccines .
The CHMP expressed concerns that there is evidence of unpredictable variability in Hepatitis B antibody response following vaccination with Hexavac .
This variability seems to be related to currently uncontrollable variances in the manufacturing process of the recombinant HepB vaccine component .
Concerns were expressed on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac and the potential consequences on long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and boostability post primary course of vaccination with this vaccine .
Between July and September 2005 , the marketing authorisation holder gave oral explanations to the CHMP and its working parties on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in long-term protection against Hepatitis B afforded by Hexavac .
On 14 September 2005 , the European Commission ( EC ) triggered the procedure under Article 18 of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2309 / 93 , as amended , after the CHMP expressed concerns on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac .
The CHMP was requested to give an opinion as to whether the marketing authorisation for Hexavac should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn in the context of an Article 18 of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2309 / 93 , as amended , procedure .
DISCUSSION
The concerns over the immunogenicity of the HepB component increased when lower than expected seroconversion rates were observed following the concomitant administration of Hexavac with other meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines .
These observations led to an intensive investigation programme agreed by the MAH to identify the reason for the lower immune response .
Unpredictable variances to the immunogenicity of the HepB component were investigated by the MAH .
The MAH proposed the development of strategies to identify the source of the problem , as well as to produce a more immunogenic formulation .
Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been investigated by the marketing authorisation holder ( MAH ) , and a modified process step was identified as the most likely strategy to enhance immunogenicity of the HepB component .
Additional concerns were raised by the recent finding that children primary immunised with Hexavac apparently respond to a booster dose of a monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine as a function of the geometric mean titres ( GMTs ) achieved upon completion of the primary immunisation series .
Infants with an initial immune response between 10 and 100 mIU / ml anti HBsAg responded less efficiently or not at all to a single dose of monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine given at the age of 7-9 years , compared to those with initial titres between 100 and 1000 mIU / ml . These findings were based on a rather limited
1 number of infants but raised concerns because the findings of a challenge &apos; weaker &quot; than priming with or without booster dose are unexpected .
On the other hand , there are currently no reports on Hepatitis B breakthrough cases after Hexavac vaccination , considering that the EU is a low endemic region and individual risks would potentially increase only later in life .
Nevertheless , in accordance with the current knowledge , the CHMP considers that childhood Hepatitis B vaccines should be as immunogenic as possible necessitating a maximum of a single booster dose during adolescence to ensure protective efficacy at the time vaccinated subjects might be exposed to a higher risk of infection compared to infancy and childhood .
The MAH reiterated their commitment to establish a test to discriminate batches of Hexavac which have elucidated a good vs. an insufficient immune response during clinical trials .
Furthermore , the MAH has proposed to change the Product Information ( PI ) , namely separate administration of pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines .
Continuous efforts are being made to improve the immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac .
The MAH proposed also to perform additional studies and further develop the Hepatitis B surveillance programme .
Notwithstanding the MAH proposals , the CHMP considered that the applicability of the MAH proposals need to be substantiated by data , which validity needs to be determined .
Furthermore , the proposed amendments to the PI wording were insufficient to adequately address negative consequences on HepB efficacy resulting from variances in the manufacturing process .
CONCLUSION
Overall , the CHMP considered the multifactorial nature of the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in Hexavac .
Reference was made to the highly variable quality of the HepB component contained in Hexavac emerging from a manufacturing production in which the root cause of the low immunogenicity has failed to be identified .
These facts were put into perspective with the clinical consequences observed so far and the apparent low benefits and uncertainties obtained from the Hepatitis B vaccination utilising Hexavac for the target population .
Considering the data on low immunogenicity available today , the CHMP identified a potential risk associated to continued vaccination with Hexavac , in terms of long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and subject boostability post priming with Hexavac .
The CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
The CHMP considered that clinical alternatives exist , i. e. hexavalent vaccines or equivalent combinations of vaccines containing the same components as Hexavac .
Considering all points raised , including time lines required to fully explore all issues related to low HepB immunogenicity following vaccination with Hexavac , the CHMP recommended the suspension for the Marketing Authorisation of Hexavac .
2 GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC
WHEREAS
The CHMP is of the Opinion that Hexavac , can no longer be maintained in normal clinical usage for the following reasons :
• Considering the data on low immunogenicity available today , the CHMP identified a potential risk associated to continued vaccination with Hexavac , in terms of long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and subject boostability post priming with Hexavac .
• The CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
• The CHMP considered that the benefit / risk balance of Hexavac for primary and booster vaccination of children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , Hepatitis B caused by all known subtypes of viruses , poliomyelitis and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b , was not favourable .
The CHMP has recommended the suspension of the Marketing Authorisations for Hexavac .

Questions and answers on the referral for Implanon subdermal implant etonogestrel 68 mg
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed an arbitration procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Implanon .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Implanon outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation granted in the Netherlands can be recognised in other Member States of the European Union .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Implanon ?
Implanon is a female contraceptive .
It is presented as a small rod that is implanted by a doctor or a nurse using a special applicator just under the skin of the upper arm .
The active substance in Implanon , etonogestrel , is a synthetic female hormone resembling progesterone .
Once implanted , the rod releases a small amount of etonogestrel continuously into the bloodstream .
This changes the body &quot; s hormonal balance and help to prevent ovulation .
Implanon can protect for up to three years ; at the end of this period the implant must be removed .
Why was Implanon reviewed ?
N. V .
Organon submitted Implanon for a second renewal of the marketing authorisation through mutual recognition on the basis of the initial authorisation granted by the Netherlands on 25 August 1998 .
The company wanted the renewal of authorisation to be recognised in all the EU Member States , as well as Norway and Iceland where the product is already authorised .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 6 October 2008 , the Dutch regulatory agency referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns regarding the side effects related to insertion and removal of the implant , the risk of breast cancer , the incidence of irregular bleedings leading to premature removal of the implant .
Additionally , the data on effectiveness in obese women in particular in the third year of use was considered insufficient .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
Based on the evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Implanon outweigh its risks , and therefore the renewal of the marketing authorisation for Implanon should be granted in all concerned member states .
The CHMP also endorsed the changes to the product information for the medicine as agreed by the Coordination Group for the Mutual and Decentralised Procedures .
The European Commission issued a decision on 6 February 2009 .

Common Name :
Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide ( polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ) conjugated to tetanus toxoid and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C ( MenC ) polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Menitorix , 5 micrograms PRP with 12,5 micrograms TT , 5 micrograms PSC with 5 micrograms TT in the form of Powder and Solvent for Solution for Injection is a vaccine , indicated for the prevention of invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) and Neisseria meningitidis group C ( MenC ) in infants from the age of 2 months and children up to the age of 2 years .
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals submitted applications for mutual recognition of Menitorix , 5 micrograms PRP with 12,5 micrograms TT , 5 micrograms PSC with 5 micrograms TT in the form of powder and solvent for solution for injection , on the basis of the marketing authorisation granted by the United Kingdom on 19 December 2005 .
The Mutual Recognition Procedure started on 17 October 2006 .
The Reference Member State was the United Kingdom and the Concerned Member States were Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Poland and Spain .
These Member States were not able to reach an agreement in respect of the Mutual Recognition of the Marketing Authorisation granted by the Reference Member State .
The United Kingdom referred the reasons for disagreement to the EMEA on 29 March 2007 .
Public health objections were raised because no immunological correlates of protection were established for MenC conjugates and because the submission of data on pre-licensure effectiveness were required to cover infant and toddler use .
Furthermore , it could not be accepted that no data on the use of Menitorix or on antibody persistence beyond the second year of life was provided .
These objections were considered to be of serious public health concern .
The arbitration procedure started on 26 April 2007 with the adoption of a list of questions .
The Rapporteur was Dr Ian Hudson and Co-Rapporteur was Dr Michał Piroż ynski .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided written explanations on 19 July 2007 and on 17 October 2007 .
During their November 2007 meeting , the CHMP , in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee , was of the opinion that the benefit / risk ratio is favourable for Menitorix , that the objections raised by Greece , Poland and Spain should not prevent the granting of a Marketing Authorisation and that the Summary of Product Characteristics , labelling and package leaflet of the Reference Member State should be amended .

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE ( CHMP ) OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 31 REFERRAL
Norfloxacin containing medicinal products
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : norfloxacin
BACKGROUND INFORMATION *
Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum , quinolone bactericidal agent indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic complicated or uncomplicated pyelonephritis due to susceptible organisms .
On 14 September 2007 , Belgium referred the matter to the EMEA under Article 31 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC and asked the CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for oral formulations of medicinal products containing norfloxacin in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated or uncomplicated pyelonephritis should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn across the European Union following the re-assessment of norfloxacin benefit / risk balance .
This request was based on the following reasons :
- Pyelonephritis is often associated with bacteraemia .
Norfloxacin containing medicinal products ,
which are only available as an oral formulation , do not provide adequate serum levels for the treatment of concomitant bacteraemia .
- There are other alternative treatments available for the above-mentioned indication . Second
generation fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin , ofloxacin and levofloxacin show higher serum concentrations and a much better tissue distribution than norfloxacin .
- Complicated pyelonephritis can be treated orally or intravenously ( according to local treatment
policy and diagnostic criteria used for defining complicated infection ) .
In case of oral treatment , second generation fluoroquinolones are superior to norfloxacin because they present higher serum and tissue levels .
The same objections are obviously valid for the oral treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis .
The referral procedure started on 20 September 2007 .
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed were :
Dr .
Ondř ej Slanař and Dr .
Pieter Neels , respectively .
Written explanations were provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder by 25 February and 20 June 2008 .
Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the Rapporteurs &quot; assessment reports , the CHMP concluded that for oral formulations of norfloxacin containing medicinal products the benefit does not outweigh the risk in acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis , and therefore adopted an opinion on 24 July 2008 recommending the variation of the Marketing Authorisations by removing the therapeutic indication &quot; acute and chronic complicated pyelonephritis &quot; from the Product Information for the norfloxacin containing medicinal products taken orally .
The list of product names concerned is given in the Annex I. The scientific conclusions are provided in the Annex II .
* Notes : The information given in this document and Annexes reflect only the CHMP Opinion dated 24 July 2008 .
The Member States competent authorities will continue to keep the product under regular review .

Questions and answers on the referral for Sabumalin salbutamol , metered dose aerosol inhaler , 100 μ g / dose
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Sabumalin .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Sabumalin outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation can be granted in Sweden as well as in the following Member States of the European Union : Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovenia , Spain and the United Kingdom .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Sabumalin ?
Sabumalin is a medicine in a pressurised inhaler that contains salbutamol as active substance .
Salbutamol is a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist .
This means that salbutamol activates the beta2- receptors in the body .
When given by inhalation as in Sabumalin , salbutamol directly activates the beta2-receptors in the respiratory system .
This makes the airways widen , allowing the air to flow more freely .
Sabumalin is used to treat the breathing difficulties caused by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
It can also be used to prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise or other triggering factors , such as house dust , pollen , cats , dogs and cigarette smoke .
Sabumalin is used to relieve symptoms , and its use should not delay the use of inhaled steroids .
Sabumalin is a &apos; generic medicine . &quot;
This means that Sabumalin is similar to a &apos; reference medicine &quot; already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) called Sultanol inhaler .
Why was Sabumalin reviewed ?
Hexal AG submitted Sabumalin to the Swedish medicines regulatory agency for a decentralised procedure on 5 December 2006 .
This is a procedure when one Member State ( the &apos; reference Member State , &quot; in this instance Sweden ) assesses a medicine with a view of granting a marketing authorisation that will be valid in this country as well as in other member states ( the &apos; concerned Member States , &quot; in this instance Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovenia , Spain and the United Kingdom ) .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 4 March 2008 , the Swedish medicines regulatory agency referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns regarding that there was not enough data showing that Sabumalin is equivalent to the reference medicine .
Concerns were also raised regarding how to store the inhaler and the effect of the orientation of the inhaler on the delivery of the medicine .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ? Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Sabumalin outweigh its risks , and that therefore the marketing authorisation for Sabumalin should be granted in all concerned member states .

Questions and answers on the referral for Sanohex salbutamol , metered dose aerosol inhaler , 100 μ g / dose
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Sanohex .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Sanohex outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation can be granted in Sweden as well as in the following Member States of the European Union : Austria , Germany , Ireland and Spain .

Questions and answers on the referral for Uman Big Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulins , 180 IU / ml , solution for injection
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a referral procedure following a disagreement among Member States of the European Union regarding the authorisation of the medicine Uman Big 180 IU / ml , solution for injection .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that the benefits of Uman Big outweigh its risks , and that the marketing authorisation granted in Italy can be recognised in other Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 29 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Uman Big ?
Uman Big is a solution of human hepatitis B immunoglobulins .
Immunoglobulins are blood proteins that have been extracted from donor plasma .
Hepatitis B immunoglobulins contain high levels of antibodies against the hepatitis B virus .
Uman Big is given as an intramuscular ( into the muscle ) injection to prevent hepatitis B in the following cases : • in case of accidental exposure in people who have not been vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus ; including those whose vaccination is incomplete or status unknown ; • in haemodialysed patients ( patients whose kidneys have failed and who rely on a blood purification technique called haemodialysis ) , until vaccination has become effective ; • in the newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother ; • in subjects who did not show an immune response after vaccination ( and for whom a continuous prevention is necessary due to the continuous risk of being infected with hepatitis B .
Why was Uman Big reviewed ?
Kedrion S. p . A. submitted Uman Big for mutual recognition on the basis of the initial authorisation granted by Italy on 2 June 1979 .
The company wanted the authorisation to be recognised in Austria , Denmark , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Poland , Portugal and Sweden ( the concerned Member States ) .
These member states were not able to reach an agreement .
On 31 October 2008 , the Italian medicines agency , Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco , referred the matter to the CHMP .
The grounds for the referral were concerns over the insufficiency of the clinical data submitted to establish the efficacy of the product .
In addition , the absence of product specific safety data or post- marketing safety data was raised as a concern .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
Based on evaluation of the currently available data and the scientific discussion within the Committee and at the CHMP &quot; s Blood Products Working Party , the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Uman Big outweigh its risks , and that therefore the marketing authorisation for Uman Big should be granted in all concerned member states .
The European Commission issued a decision on 06 March 2009 .

What is Fevaxyn Pentofel ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel is a vaccine for cats which is a solution for injection in a prefilled syringe .
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains the following inactivated viruses : Feline Panleukopenia Virus , Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus , Feline Calicivirus , Feline Leukaemia Virus , and the inactivated bacterium Feline Chlamydia psittaci .
What is Fevaxyn Pentofel used for ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel is used to immunise healthy cats of 9 weeks or older against Feline Panleukopenia and Feline Leukaemia and against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci .
The contents of the prefilled syringe are shaken and given by subcutaneous ( under the skin ) injection .
For cats 9 weeks and older , two doses are given at an interval of 3 to 4 weeks .
An additional dose is recommended for kittens living in high-risk areas for Feline Leukaemia Virus whose first dose was administered before 12 weeks of age .
Fevaxyn Pentofel is then given once every year .
How does Fevaxyn Pentofel work ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains small amounts of four inactivated viruses and one inactivated bacterium .
When injected , this small exposure helps the cat &quot; s immune system to recognise and attack the viruses and bacterium .
When exposed to any of these viruses and bacterium later in life , the cat will either not become infected or will have a much less serious infection .
How has the effectiveness of Fevaxyn Pentofel been studied ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel has been studied against Feline Leukaemia , against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci , as well as against disease caused by Feline Panleukopenia virus . In addition , studies in cats of various breeds were carried out to observe any side effects of Fevaxyn Pentofel after the first and second vaccinations .

What is ProMeris ?
ProMeris is a clear yellow to amber solution that contains metaflumizone as active substance .
It is given to cats with a pre-filled spot-on pipette , a small plastic container which is already filled with the correct amount of ProMeris needed to treat one cat ( ProMeris is available in 2 different sizes for various cat weights ) .
The content of the pipette is squeezed onto the skin after parting the fur between the shoulder blades of the cat .
What is ProMeris used for ?
ProMeris is an &quot; ectoparasiticide , &quot; this means that it will kill parasites that live on the skin or in the fur of animals , such as fleas and ticks .
ProMeris is used to treat and to prevent flea infestations in cats .
It can also be used as part of a treatment strategy for the control of Flea Allergy Dermatitis , an allergic reaction of cats to flea bites .
Once applied , it remains active for up to 6 weeks .
How does ProMeris work ?
The active substance of ProMeris , metaflumizone , interferes with the neural activity of the fleas and consequently leads to the death of these parasites . How has ProMeris been studied ? Data were provided on the pharmaceutical quality , the safety of the product in cats and the safety in humans ( people in contact with the product ) and the environment . The effectiveness of metaflumizone against flea infestations in cats was investigated in laboratory studies and in a field trial .

Cats from various breeds ( mainly European shorthair ) , age groups and weight that were infested with fleas were either treated with ProMeris or with other products authorised in the EU for this indication .
The effectiveness was measured looking at the number of fleas on the cat at various times up to 2 months after application .
What benefit has ProMeris shown during the studies ?
The results of the field trial showed that ProMeris is effective in the treatment and prevention of flea infestations in cats .
The medicine killed fleas within 24 hours after treatment and its effectiveness lasted 6 weeks .
What is the risk associated with ProMeris ?
There may be a change in appearance of the fur ( oily appearance and clumping or spiking of hair ) at the application site .
If a cat licks the application area , the cat might salivate considerably for a short period .
ProMeris should not be used in cats less than 8 weeks old since it has not been sufficiently studied in these animals .
As other products of this group , ProMeris should not be used in sick animals or cats that have just recovered from illness .
This product is specifically developed for cats and should not be used in any other animal species .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
As a precautionary measure , direct contact with the treated cat should be avoided and children should not be allowed to play with a treated animal until the application site is dry .
Recently treated animals should not be allowed to sleep in the same bed as their owners , especially children .
Skin contact with the pipette content should be avoided .
Skin should be washed and eyes should be rinsed with water , if accidental exposure occurred .
When administering ProMeris , the user should not smoke , eat or drink .
Why has ProMeris been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of ProMeris exceed the risks for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations in cats . The Committee recommended that ProMeris be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

What is Rheumocam ?
Rheumocam is a yellowish opaque oral suspension which is to be given mixed with food .
Rheumocam contains the active substance meloxicam in a strength of 1.5 mg / ml .
Rheumocam is a &apos; generic &quot; which means that Rheumocam is similar to a &apos; reference veterinary medicine &quot; already authorised in the EU ( Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension ) .
Studies have been carried out to prove that Rheumocam is &apos; bioequivalent &quot; to the reference veterinary medicine which means that Rheumocam is equivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml suspension in the way it is absorbed and used by the body .
What is Rheumocam used for ?
Rheumocam is used in dogs to relieve inflammation and pain in musculo-skeletal disorders .
It can be used for both acute disorders , such as those seen after an injury , and chronic ( long term ) disorders .
Rheumocam is given to the dog once a day , with food , at the dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam / kg body weight on the first day , then at 0.1 mg / kg afterwards .
The amount of suspension to be used is measured using a special dosing syringe ( provided in the product package ) and poured on the food .
How does Rheumocam work ?
Rheumocam contains meloxicam , which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Meloxicam acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .
As the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation , pain , exudation and fever , meloxicam reduces those responses . How has the effectiveness of Rheumocam been studied ? A study looked at how Rheumocam was absorbed and its effects in the body , in comparison with Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged What are the side-effects of Rheumocam ?
Occasional side effects of Rheumocam are those seen with NSAIDs , such as loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea , blood appearing in the stools and apathy ( lack of vitality ) .
These side effects occur generally within the first week of treatment and are usually temporary and disappear once treatment has stopped .
In very rare cases they may be serious or fatal .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
People who are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to NSAIDs should avoid contact with Rheumocam .
If the product is swallowed by a person , the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately .
Why has Rheumocam been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) considered that , in accordance with European Union requirements , Rheumocam has been shown to be bioequivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension .
Therefore the CVMP &quot; s view was that , as for Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension , Rheumocam &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks when treating inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs and they recommended that Rheumocam should be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

INGELVAC CIRCOFLEX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report . Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
If you need more information about your animal &quot; s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Ingelvac CircoFLEX ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is a vaccine for use in pigs , which is available as a suspension for injection .
It contains a protein ( antigen ) from the porcine circovirus type 2 virus ( PCV2 ) .
The vaccine does not contain any live PCV2 and the antigen cannot replicate in the animal .
What is Ingelvac CircoFLEX used for ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is used to vaccinate pigs from two weeks of age against PCV2 infection .
This helps to reduce deaths , signs of disease such as weight loss , and damage to lymphoid tissue associated with this infection .
It can also reduce shedding of the virus from the nose , the level of the virus in the blood and lymphoid tissue , and the duration of blood infection ( viraemia ) with the virus .
The vaccine is given by injection into a muscle .
Onset of protection against PCV2 occurs from as early as two weeks after the injection and lasts for at least 17 weeks .
How does Ingelvac CircoFLEX work ?
Porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) is known to cause a wide variety of clinical signs and syndromes in pigs , some of which may be caused by PCV2 in combination with other agents .
PCV2 associated infections may include symptoms such as weight loss or failure to grow , enlarged lymph nodes , difficulty breathing , diarrhoea , pale skin and jaundice ( yellowing of the skin ) .
Ingelvac CircoFLEX is a vaccine .
Vaccines work by &apos; teaching &quot; the immune system ( the body &quot; s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease .
Ingelvac CircoFLEX contains small amounts of a protein from PCV2 .
When a pig is given the vaccine , the pig &quot; s immune system recognises the protein as &apos; foreign &quot; and reacts by building up an active immune response .
In the future , the immune system will be able to react against the virus more quickly when it is exposed to the virus .
This active immune response will help to protect the pig against the disease caused by this virus .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged How has Ingelvac CircoFLEX been studied ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX has been studied in a number of trials involving pigs of various breeds .
These studies have been performed under laboratory as well as under typical European farming conditions .
The main measure of effectiveness was the rate of weight gain in the vaccinated pigs , but the studies also looked at other parameters including symptoms , the level of PCV2 in the blood and the number of runts .
What benefit has Ingelvac CircoFLEX shown during the studies ?
The trials showed that vaccination of pigs with Ingelvac CircoFLEX reduced weight loss in the piglets .
It also reduced the levels of PCV2 in the blood , symptoms of PCV2 infection , the number of runts and death rates .
What is the risk associated with Ingelvac CircoFLEX ?
Ingelvac CircoFLEX can cause a mild , temporary increase in body temperature , usually on the day of vaccination .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
There are no special precautions for the person who gives Ingelvac CircoFLEX or comes into contact with the animal .
What is the time allowed before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
The withdrawal period is zero days .
Why has Ingelvac CircoFLEX been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Ingelvac CircoFLEX exceed the risks for the active immunisation of pigs , over the age of two weeks , against PCV2 , and recommended that Ingelvac CircoFLEX be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

What is Duvaxyn WNV ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine containing an inactivated West Nile virus ( inactivated means that the virus has been killed so that it cannot cause the disease any more ) .
What is Duvaxyn WNV used for ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine used in horses to protect against West Nile virus disease .
The vaccine reduces the number of viraemic horses ( these are horses with virus circulating in their blood stream ) The vaccine is injected intramuscularly ( into a muscle ) in the neck of the horse .
How does Duvaxyn WNV work ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine .
When it is given to horses , the animal &quot; s immune system ( their natural defence mechanism ) learns how to make antibodies ( a special type of protein ) to fight the disease .
In the future , if the horses are exposed to the West Nile virus , the immune system will be able to make those antibodies quicker and this will help them fight the disease .
How has Duvaxyn WNV been studied ?
The company carried out laboratory safety studies in both young foals ( 6 months of age ) and pregnant mares using the vaccine .
These showed the safety of the use of the vaccine in horses in general and in young ( 6 months of age or older ) and pregnant animals in particular .
They then performed a number of field trials which further confirmed the safety of Duvaxyn WNV and proved its efficacy in reducing the number of viraemic horses and thereby protecting against the disease .

What is Levemir ?
Levemir is a clear colourless solution for injection .
It is available in a cartridge ( PenFill ) or in a prefilled pen ( FlexPen and InnoLet ) .
Levemir contains the active ingredient insulin detemir .
What is Levemir used for ?
Levemir is used to treat patients ( adults and children over the age of 6 ) who have diabetes .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Levemir used ?
Levemir is administered subcutaneously ( under the skin ) by injection in the abdominal wall ( tummy ) , the thigh , or the upper arm .
Levemir is a long-acting insulin .
It can be used in the following ways : • once a day as an add-on to oral anti-diabetes medicines .
The dose should be adjusted according to the individual patients &quot; blood glucose levels , • in combination with injections at mealtimes of a short- or rapid-acting insulin .
It should be given once or twice a day depending on patients &quot; needs .
The patient &quot; s blood glucose should be regularly tested to find the lowest effective dose .
How does Levemir work ?
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar .
Levemir is a replacement insulin which is very similar to the insulin made by the pancreas . The active ingredient of Levemir , insulin detemir , is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology . &quot;
It is made by a yeast that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce insulin detemir .
Insulin detemir is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it is absorbed more slowly by the body , and takes longer to reach its target in the body .
This means that Levemir has a long duration of action .
The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood .
How has Levemir been studied ?
Levemir has been studied in 1,575 patients with type 1 diabetes , when the pancreas cannot produce insulin , and over 2,400 patients with type 2 diabetes , when the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
The studies compared Levemir to human insulin NPH ( an intermediate-acting insulin ) or to insulin glargine ( a long-acting insulin ) .
The medicines were given as once or twice daily injections .
Injections of fast-acting insulin were also used at mealtimes .
In four of the six studies in type 2 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

All studies measured the level of glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled .
What benefit has Levemir shown during the studies ?
The studies showed that Levemir controls HbA1c in a similar manner to insulin NPH , with less risk of low blood glucose level during the night and no associated weight gain .
In combination with oral anti- diabetes medicines , Levemir also controlled HbA1c in a similar manner to insulin glargine .
What is the risk associated with Levemir ?
The most common side effects when taking Levemir ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) and injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) .
In patients also taking oral anti-diabetes medicines , a common side effect is signs of allergy .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Levemir , see the Package Leaflet .
Levemir should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive to insulin detemir or any of the other ingredients .
Levemir doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar ( the full list is available in the Package Leaflet ) .
Why has Levemir been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Levemir &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes mellitus . They recommended that Levemir be given marketing authorisation .
Other information about Levemir :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Levemir to Novo Nordisk A / S on 1 June 2004 .

What is Humira ?
Humira is a medicine containing the active substance adalimumab .
It is available as a solution for injection in a vial , pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen , all containing 40 mg adalimumab .
What is Humira used for ?
Humira is an anti-inflammatory medicine .
It is used to treat the following groups of patients : • adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis ( an immune system disease causing inflammation of the joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments , and adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis that is progressive ( getting worse ) who have not taken methotrexate ( another medicine that acts on the immune system ) before .
Humira is used in combination with methotrexate , or on its own in patients who cannot take methotrexate ; • adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( an immune system disease affecting children and adolescents that causes inflammation of at least five joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments .
Humira is used in combination with methotrexate , or on its own in patients who cannot take methotrexate ; • adults with active and progressive psoriatic arthritis ( a disease causing red , scaly patches on the skin and inflammation of the joints ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis ( a disease causing inflammation and pain in the joints of the spine ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with severe active Crohn &quot; s disease ( a disease causing inflammation of the gut ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments ; • adults with psoriasis ( a disease causing red , scaly patches on the skin ) who have not responded adequately to other treatments . See the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) for full details . The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Humira used ? Treatment with Humira must be initiated and supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the diseases that Humira is used to treat . The recommended dose is 40 mg given every two weeks as an injection under the skin , but for Crohn &quot; s disease and psoriasis , an initial dose of 80 mg is given , followed by 40 mg every two weeks . Patients who need a more rapid response for Crohn &quot; s disease may need to start with two higher doses 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

( 160 mg followed by 80 mg ) , although this might increase the risk of side effects .
Patients may be given other medicines during treatment with Humira , such as corticosteroids ( other anti-inflammatory medicines ) .
After training , patients may inject themselves with Humira if their doctor agrees .
Patients who take Humira must be given the special alert card that summarises the safety information about the medicine .
For more information , see the Package Leaflet .
How does Humira work ?
The active substance in Humira , adalimumab , is a monoclonal antibody .
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody ( a type of protein ) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure ( called an antigen ) that is found in the body .
Adalimumab has been designed to bind to a chemical messenger in the body called tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) .
This messenger is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that Humira is used to treat .
By blocking TNF , adalimumab reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases .
How has Humira been studied ?
Humira has been studied in five studies of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis .
In four of these studies , the effectiveness of Humira , alone or as an as add-on to other anti-inflammatory medicines including methotrexate , was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in over 2,000 patients .
The fifth study compared the combination of Humira and methotrexate to methotrexate or to Humira alone in 799 patients who had not taken methotrexate before .
For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , Humira was compared with placebo , alone or as an add- on to methotrexate , in one main study involving 171 patients aged between four and 17 years .
All of the patients received Humira for 16 weeks before being assigned to Humira or placebo for a further 32 weeks .
For psoriatic arthritis , Humira was compared with placebo over 12 weeks in two studies including 413 patients .
The medicines were taken alone or in combination with another anti-inflammatory medicine .
For ankylosing spondylitis , Humira and placebo as an add-on to existing treatment were compared over 12 weeks in two studies involving 397 patients .
For Crohn &quot; s disease , the effectiveness of the first two doses of Humira ( induction ) was compared with that of placebo in two studies involving 624 patients over four weeks .
Another study looked at the long-term effects ( maintenance ) of Humira in 854 patients over up to 56 weeks .
For psoriasis , Humira was compared with placebo over 16 weeks in 1,212 patients .
A second study compared Humira with methotrexate and with placebo in 271 patients over 16 weeks .
In all of the studies , the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms .
What benefit has Humira shown during the studies ?
Humira was more effective than placebo in all diseases studied .
In rheumatoid arthritis , the greatest reductions in symptoms were seen in the studies examining Humira as an add-on to methotrexate : around two thirds of the patients adding Humira had at least a 20 % reduction in symptoms after six months , compared with a quarter of those adding placebo .
Patients adding Humira also had less joint damage and experienced less reduction in physical function after a year .
In patients who had not taken methotrexate in the past , the combination of Humira and methotrexate was also more effective than methotrexate alone .
For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , around 40 % of the patients receiving Humira , either alone or in combination with methotrexate , had a flare-up of arthritis , compared with around 69 % of those receiving placebo .
However , fewer patients receiving Humira with methotrexate developed antibodies , so the results favoured the use of Humira with methotrexate over Humira used alone .
The fixed 40-mg dose , which is the only dose of Humira currently available , was considered to be suitable only for patients aged 13 years or above .
Humira also produced a greater improvement in symptoms than placebo in studies of psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , induction and maintenance phases of treatment for Crohn &quot; s disease , and psoriasis .
What is the risk associated with Humira ?
In studies of Humira , the most common side effect ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) was injection site reactions ( including pain , swelling , redness or itching ) .
Due to an increased risk of infection , patients taking Humira must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis during and for 2 / 3 up to five months after treatment .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Humira , see the Package Leaflet .
Humira should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients .
Humira must not be used in patients with tuberculosis , other severe infections , or moderate or severe heart failure ( an inability of the heart to pump enough blood around the body ) .
Why has Humira been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Humira &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , Crohn &quot; s disease and psoriasis . The Committee recommended that Humira be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Humira ?
The company that makes Humira will provide educational packs for doctors who will prescribe Humira .
These packs will include information on the safety of the medicine .
Other information about Humira :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Humira to Abbott Laboratories Ltd. on 8 September 2003 .
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 8 September 2008 .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
6 SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
The Belanette blister is glued in a carton which is subsequently folded to a wallet configuration .
The wallet with the inserted blister is assembled with a package leaflet ( PL ) and all components are wrapped together with clear , transparent cellophane wrapping to form the unit pack which prevents the loss of individual components .
The product is marketed in pack size of 3 x 21 film-coated tablets .
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF BELANETTE AND ASSOCIATED NAMES ( see Annex I )
The required basic information ( how to use the product , what to do in case of missed dose , etc . ) , which ensures the safe use of the product is present on the cardboard wallets and visible through the cellophane wrapping .
Once the cellophane wrapping is removed the safe use of the product is still ensured as the cardboard wallets contain the required information .
In addition it is not possible to separate blisters from cardboard wallets and therefore the users always have access to the required information .
Moreover cardboard wallets protect blisters against damage .
The risk resulting from the separation of a package leaflet from cardboard wallets is comparable with the risk resulting from separation of blisters from conventional external packaging ( cardboard box ) .
Although different observations in respect to readability of the Braille text through the cellophane wrapping have been made by blind users , it is assumed that before use of the product the cellophane wrapping will be removed and therefore blind person will be in a position to identify the product .
It has also been confirmed by blind persons that the Braille text on the cardboard is palpable and readable .
Since it is a prescription medicine , the name of the product always will be known to the blind user as during the visit the physicians inform patients about medicinal product they are prescribing , including the name of the product .
Therefore blind users will be able to double check the information written on the cardboard wallets ( Braille text ) with the information obtained from a physician ( during the visit ) .
Finally taking into account that the medicinal product is intended for long term use , the possible mistakes and misuse are further minimised .

BINOCRIT
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Binocrit ?
Binocrit is a solution for injection .
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international units ( IU ) of the active substance , epoetin alfa .
Binocrit is a &apos; biosimilar &quot; medicine .
This means that Binocrit is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also known as the &apos; reference medicine &quot; ) .
The reference medicine for Binocrit is Eprex / Erypo .
For more information on biosimilar medicines , see the question-and-answer document here .
What is Binocrit used for ?
Binocrit is used in the following situations : • to treat anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) that is causing symptoms in patients with &apos; chronic renal failure &quot; ( long-term , progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly ) or other kidney problems ; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions ; • to increase the amount of blood that can be taken in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery ( autologous blood transfusion ) ; • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery , such as hip surgery .
It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion , if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Binocrit used ?
Treatment with Binocrit must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for .
For patients with kidney problems and patients who are going to donate their own blood , Binocrit must be injected into a vein .
Patients receiving chemotherapy or about to undergo orthopaedic surgery must be injected under the skin . Binocrit can be injected under the skin by the patient or their carer if

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. they have been trained appropriately .
The dose , the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Binocrit is being used , and are adjusted according to the patient &quot; s response .
For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy , haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per decilitre in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body .
For these patients , the lowest dose that provides adequate control of symptoms should be used .
The iron levels of all patients should be checked before treatment to make sure that they are not too low , and iron supplements should be used throughout treatment .
For full details , see the Package Leaflet .
How does Binocrit work ?
A hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells from the bone marrow .
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys .
In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems , anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin , or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it has naturally .
In these cases , erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell counts .
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and help minimise the consequences of blood loss .
The active substance in Binocrit , epoetin alfa , is a copy of human erythropoietin and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production .
The epoetin alfa in Binocrit is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology &quot; : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce epoetin alfa .
How has Binocrit been studied ?
Binocrit was studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine , Eprex / Erypo , in experimental models and in humans .
Binocrit , injected into a vein , was compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems .
All of the patients had been taking Eprex / Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Binocrit or remained on Eprex / Erypo .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period , between weeks 25 and 29 .
The company also presented the results of a study comparing the effects of Binocrit injected under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy .
What benefit has Binocrit shown during the studies ?
Binocrit was as effective as Eprex / Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell counts .
In the study of patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems , patients switching to Binocrit maintained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo .
On average , the levels of the patients taking Binocrit increased by 0.147 g / dl from a starting value of 11.7 g / dl .
In comparison , those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g / dl from a starting value of 12.0 g / dl .
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Binocrit was also as effective as Eprex / Erypo when it was injected under the skin .
What is the risk associated with Binocrit ?
The most common side effect with Binocrit is an increase in blood pressure , which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion .
Binocrit can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptoms .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Binocrit , see the Package Leaflet .
Binocrit should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in the following groups : • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia ( reduced or stopped red blood cell production ) following treatment with any erythropoietin ; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled ; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack or stroke within the last month , who have angina pectoris ( a severe type of chest pain ) or who are at risk of deep venous thrombosis ( DVT : formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body , usually in the leg ) ; 2 / 3 • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots ; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular ( heart and blood vessel ) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke .
Binocrit is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
Why has Binocrit been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirements , Binocrit has been shown to have a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile to Eprex / Erypo .
Therefore , the CHMP &quot; s view was that , as for Eprex / Erypo , the benefit outweighs the identified risks . The Committee recommended that Binocrit be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Binocrit ?

VECTIBIX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Vectibix ?
Vectibix is a concentrate that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance panitumumab .
What is Vectibix used for ?
Vectibix is used to treat metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum .
This is cancer of the lower intestine ( large bowel ) that has spread to other parts of the body .
Vectibix is used on its own in patients whose tumour cells have a protein on their surface called the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and which contain a non-mutated &apos; KRAS . &quot;
KRAS is a gene that , when mutated in tumour cells , stimulates tumour growth .
Vectibix is used after treatment with combinations of anticancer medicines that include a &apos; fluoropyrimidine &quot; ( such as 5-fluorouracil ) , oxaliplatin and irinotecan has stopped working .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Vectibix used ?
Treatment with Vectibix should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the use of anticancer therapy .
It should only be started once detection of non-mutated KRAS has been performed by an experienced laboratory using a reliable method .
The recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg per kilogram body weight given once every two weeks as an infusion .
The recommended infusion time is around 60 minutes , but larger doses may need 90 minutes .
How does Vectibix work ?
The active substance in Vectibix , panitumumab , is a monoclonal antibody .
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody ( a type of protein ) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure ( called an antigen ) that is found on certain cells in the body .
Panitumumab has been designed to bind to EGFR , which can be found on the surface of certain cells , including cells in some tumours .
As a result of this binding , these tumour cells can no longer receive the messages transmitted via EGFR that they need for growth , progression and spreading ( metastasis ) . Panitumumab does not seem to work in tumour cells that contain mutated KRAS .
This is because their growth is not controlled by signals transmitted via EGFR and they continue to grow even when the EGFR is blocked .

How has Vectibix been studied ?
The effects of Vectibix were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Vectibix has been studied in one main study involving a total of 463 patients with colon and rectum cancer whose disease had got worse during or after previous treatment that included a fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin and irinotecan .
The effects of Vectibix in addition to &apos; best supportive care &quot; were compared with those of best supportive care alone .
Best supportive care is any medicines or techniques to help patients , such as antibiotics , painkillers , transfusions and surgery , but not other anticancer medicines .
The main measure of effectiveness was the time taken before the disease started to get worse or the patient died .
The results of the study were analysed separately in 243 patients whose tumours contained KRAS that had not mutated and in 184 patients in whom the KRAS gene contained a mutation .
What benefit has Vectibix shown during the studies ?
In the patients with non-mutated KRAS in their tumours , Vectibix prolonged the time until the disease got worse or the patient died : this took an average of 12.3 weeks in the patients who took Vectibix in addition to best supportive care , compared with 7.3 weeks in those who received best supportive care alone .
In contrast , there was no effect of Vectibix in the patients with mutated KRAS in their tumours , with an average time of around 7.3 weeks until disease progression or death in both groups of patients .
What is the risk associated with Vectibix ?
Around 90 % of patients receiving Vectibix have side effects affecting the skin , although most of these are mild or moderate .
The most common side effects with Vectibix ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are rash , erythema ( redness of the skin ) , skin exfoliation ( skin flaking ) , pruritus ( itching ) , dry skin , skin fissures ( cracks in the skin ) , paronychia ( nail bed infection ) , diarrhoea , fatigue ( tiredness ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , vomiting , dyspnoea ( difficulty breathing ) and cough .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Vectibix , see the Package Leaflet .
Vectibix should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to panitumumab or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients with interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis ( lung diseases ) .
Why has Vectibix been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that Vectibix &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated ( wild-type ) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine- , oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens . The Committee recommended that Vectibix be given marketing authorisation .
Vectibix has been given &apos; Conditional Approval . &quot;
This means that there is more evidence to come about the medicine , in particular its safety and effectiveness in patients whose tumours contain non-mutated KRAS .
Every year , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary .
What information is still awaited for Vectibix ?
The company that makes Vectibix will supply the results of additional studies looking at the safety and effectiveness of the medicine in patients with colorectal cancer with and without mutated KRAS , as well as at the quality of life in patients receiving it .
These include studies looking at the use of Vectibix in combination with other medicines , both in patients whose disease has been treated before and in patients who have not received any previous treatment for their cancer , as well as a study to confirm the effectiveness of Vectibix , given on its own , in its approved use .

ZYPADHERA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .

What is Zypadhera ?
Zypadhera is a powder and solvent that are made up into a prolonged-release suspension for injection .
It contains the active substance olanzapine . &apos; Prolonged release &quot; means that the active substance is released slowly over a few weeks after being injected .
What is Zypadhera used for ?
Zypadhera is used to maintain the improvement in symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have already been stabilised on an initial course of olanzapine taken by mouth .
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that has a number of symptoms , including disorganised thinking and speech , hallucinations ( hearing or seeing things that are not there ) , suspiciousness and delusions ( false beliefs ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Zypadhera used ?
Zypadhera is given by deep injection into the buttock muscle by a doctor or nurse who has been trained in giving this type of injection .
In rare cases , patients receiving Zypadhera may experience symptoms of olanzapine overdose after injection if the medicine is accidentally injected into a vein .
Symptoms of overdose include sedation ( sleepiness ) and delirium ( confusion ) .
Because patients should be monitored by qualified staff for these symptoms for at least three hours after injection , they should receive Zypadhera at a centre with the appropriate facilities to deal with a potential overdose .
Patients who have symptoms of overdose should continue to be monitored until the symptoms have passed .
Zypadhera must not be injected into a vein or under the skin .
Zypadhera is given at doses of 150 , 210 or 300 mg every two weeks , or 300 or 405 mg every four weeks .
The dose depends on the dose of olanzapine that the patient was previously taking by mouth .
Patients should be monitored closely for signs of relapse ( a return of symptoms ) during the first one to two months of treatment , and the dose adjusted if necessary .
Zypadhera is not recommended for patients over 65 years of age .
However , patients aged between 65 and 75 years or patients with kidney or liver problems may use Zypadhera if an effective and well- tolerated dose of oral olanzapine has been found .

How does Zypadhera work ?
The active substance in Zypadhera , olanzapine , is an antipsychotic medicine .
It is known as an &apos; atypical &quot; antipsychotic because it is different from the older antipsychotic medicines that have been available since the 1950s .
Olanzapine attaches to several different receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
This disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by &apos; neurotransmitters , &quot; chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
It is thought that olanzapine &quot; s beneficial effect is due to it blocking receptors for the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytrypamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine .
Since these neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia , olanzapine helps to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing the symptoms of the disease .
Olanzapine has been authorised in the European Union ( EU ) since 1996 .
It is available as tablets , orodispersible tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) and rapidly acting injections in Zyprexa , Zyprexa Velotab and other medicines .
The olanzapine in Zypadhera is presented as a &apos; pamoate &quot; salt , which makes the olanzapine less soluble .
As a result , the active substance is released slowly for more than four weeks after injection of Zypadhera .
How has Zypadhera been studied ?
Because olanzapine has already been authorised in the EU as Zyprexa , the company used some of the data from Zyprexa to support the use of Zypadhera .
Zypadhera has been studied in two main studies involving adults with schizophrenia .
The first looked at the initial treatment of schizophrenia and the second looked at the maintenance of response to olanzapine treatment : • the study of initial treatment compared the effects of three doses of Zypadhera with those of placebo ( dummy injections ) in 404 patients .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms measured on a standard scale for schizophrenia after eight weeks ; • the study of maintenance treatment compared the effects of four doses of Zypadhera with those of olanzapine taken by mouth in 1,065 patients .
Three of the doses of Zypadhera were &apos; high &quot; ( 300 mg and 150 mg every two weeks , and 405 mg every four weeks ) and one was &apos; low &quot; ( 45 mg every four weeks ) .
All of the patients in this study had been stabilised with other treatments for schizophrenia and had been taking olanzapine by mouth for at least six weeks before the study began .
The main measures of effectiveness were the time taken for symptoms to get worse and the number of patients whose symptoms got worse over 24 weeks .
What benefit has Zypadhera shown during the studies ?
In the study of the initial treatment of schizophrenia , Zypadhera was more effective than placebo .
Symptom scores were around 100 points at the start of the study , but had fallen by around 25 points in the patients receiving Zypadhera after eight weeks , compared with around 9 points in the patients receiving placebo .
The effectiveness of Zypadhera was greater than placebo from the second week of treatment onwards .
In the study looking at the maintenance of response to olanzapine treatment , Zypadhera was as effective as olanzapine taken by mouth :
10 % of the patients receiving Zypadhera every two weeks had a worsening of symptoms , compared with 7 % of those taking olanzapine by mouth .
The &apos; high &quot; doses of Zypadhera were more effective at preventing a worsening of symptoms than the &apos; low &quot; dose .
What is the risk associated with Zypadhera ?
The most common side effects with Zypadhera ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are weight gain , somnolence ( sleepiness ) and raised levels of prolactin ( a hormone ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Zypadhera , see the Package Leaflet .
Zypadhera should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma ( raised pressure inside the eye ) .
Why has Zypadhera been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Zypadhera is effective both in the initial treatment of schizophrenia and in maintaining a response to treatment in schizophrenia .
However , it noted that prolonged-release injections are not suitable for use as initial treatment , because the medicine takes at least a week to reduce symptoms and patients may need rapid control of symptoms .
In addition , it is not possible to stop treatment after giving a prolonged-release 2 / 3 injection , which would not be suitable for patients experiencing side effects .
Therefore , the Committee decided that Zypadhera &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for maintenance treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine . The Committee recommended that Zypadhera be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Zypadhera ?
The company that makes Zypadhera will provide an educational programme for doctors , nurses and pharmacists and a card for patients in all Member States , reminding them of how to use the medicine safely .
These will include information on what to do before and after each injection , the differences between Zypadhera and other injectable medicines containing olanzapine , and the recommendations on how patients should be monitored .
Other information about Zypadhera :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Zypadhera to Eli Lilly Nederland BV on 19 November 2008 .

TREVACLYN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Trevaclyn ?
Trevaclyn is a medicine containing two active substances : nicotinic acid ( also known as niacin or vitamin B3 ) and laropiprant .
It is available as modified-release tablets . &apos; Modified-release &quot; means that the two active substances are released at different rates from the tablet over a few hours .
What is Trevaclyn used for ?
Trevaclyn is used in addition to diet and exercise in patients with dyslipidaemia ( abnormally high levels of fat in the blood ) , particularly &apos; combined mixed dyslipidaemia &quot; and &apos; primary hypercholesterolaemia . &quot;
Patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia have high blood levels of &apos; bad &quot; LDL cholesterol and triglycerides ( a type of fat ) , and low levels of &apos; good &quot; HDL cholesterol .
Primary hypercholesterolaemia is when the levels of cholesterol in the blood are high .
Primary means that the hypercholesterolaemia does not have any identifiable cause .
Trevaclyn is normally given together with a statin ( the standard medicine used to reduce cholesterol ) when the effectiveness of a statin taken alone is inadequate .
Trevaclyn is used on its own only in patients who cannot take statins .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Trevaclyn used ?
The starting dose of Trevaclyn is one tablet once a day for four weeks , after which the dose is increased to two tablets once a day .
It is taken by mouth , with food , in the evening or before going to bed .
The tablets must be swallowed whole , and should not be split , broken , crushed or chewed .
Trevaclyn is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of a lack of information on its safety and effectiveness in this group .
It should be used with caution in patients who have problems with their kidneys and should not be used in patients with liver problems . How does Trevaclyn work ? The two active substances in Trevaclyn , nicotinic acid and laropiprant , have different modes of action .
Nicotinic acid is a naturally occurring substance that is used in low doses as a vitamin . In higher doses , it reduces the levels of fat in the blood via a mechanism that is not fully understood .

Flushing due to nicotinic acid is thought to occur because of the release of a substance called &apos; prostaglandin D2 &quot; ( PGD2 ) from cells in the skin , which dilates ( widens ) the blood vessels in the skin .
Laropiprant blocks the receptors to which PGD2 normally attaches .
When the receptors are blocked , PGD2 cannot dilate the vessels in the skin , reducing the frequency and intensity of flushing .
In Trevaclyn tablets , laropiprant is in one of the layers , and the other layer contains nicotinic acid .
When the patient takes the tablet , laropiprant is released first into the bloodstream and blocks the PGD2 receptors .
The nicotinic acid is released more slowly from the other layer and has its effect as a fat-modifying agent .
How has Trevaclyn been studied ?
The effects of Trevaclyn were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Trevaclyn was studied in four main studies in patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia .
Two studies looked at the effectiveness of Trevaclyn in modifying blood fat levels .
The first study compared the effectiveness of Trevaclyn with that of nicotinic acid alone or placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol in a total of 1,613 patients .
This study also looked at the symptoms of flushing using a specially designed questionnaire .
The second study compared the combination of Trevaclyn and simvastatin ( a statin ) with Trevaclyn alone or simvastatin alone in 1,398 patients .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the blood levels of LDL cholesterol after 12 weeks .
The third and fourth studies looked at the effectiveness of laropiprant in reducing the flushing caused by nicotinic acid .
They included a total of 2,349 patients who were taking either Trevaclyn or nicotinic acid .
Flushing was measured using the flushing symptom questionnaire .
What benefit has Trevaclyn shown during the studies ?
Trevaclyn was effective in reducing the blood levels of LDL cholesterol .
In the first study , LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 19 % in patients taking Trevaclyn , compared with 1 % in those taking placebo .
The second study showed that the LDL cholesterol levels were further reduced when Trevaclyn was taken with simvastatin ( 48 % reduction ) , compared with Trevaclyn alone ( 17 % reduction ) or simvastatin alone ( 37 % reduction ) .
Adding laropiprant to nicotinic acid reduced the symptoms of flushing caused by nicotinic acid .
In the first and third studies , fewer patients taking Trevaclyn reported moderate , severe or extreme flushing than patients taking nicotinic acid alone .
In the fourth study , flushing was seen on fewer days in patients taking Trevaclyn than in those taking nicotinic acid alone .
What is the risk associated with Trevaclyn ?
The most common side effect with Trevaclyn ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is flushing .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Trevaclyn , see the Package Leaflet .
Trevaclyn should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to nicotinic acid , laropiprant or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients who have problems with their liver , an active stomach ulcer or bleeding from an artery .
Why has Trevaclyn been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Trevaclyn &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of dyslipidaemia , particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia . The Committee recommended that Trevaclyn be given marketing authorisation .

What is Valdoxan ?
Valdoxan is a medicine that contains the active substance agomelatine .
It is available as orange- yellow , oblong tablets ( 25 mg ) .
What is Valdoxan used for ?
Valdoxan is used to treat major depression in adults .
Major depression is a condition in which patients have mood disturbances that interfere with their everyday life .
Symptoms often include deep sadness , feelings of worthlessness , loss of interest in favourite activities , sleep disturbances , a feeling of being slowed down , feelings of anxiety and changes in weight .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Valdoxan used ?
The recommended dose of Valdoxan is one tablet once a day , taken at bedtime with or without food .
If there is no improvement in symptoms after two weeks , the doctor may increase the dose to two tablets taken together at bedtime .
Patients with depression should be treated for at least six months to make sure that they are free of symptoms .
The patient &quot; s liver should be checked with blood tests when treatment starts , and then after around six , 12 and 24 weeks of treatment The liver should also be checked if the patient develops symptoms that could indicate liver problems .
Treatment should be interrupted in patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels in the blood .
Blood tests should then be repeated until the liver enzymes have returned to normal levels .
Because a benefit of Valdoxan has not been shown clearly in patients aged over 65 years , it should be used with caution in this age group .
It should also be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe kidney problems .
It must not be used in patients who have liver problems .
How does Valdoxan work ? The active substance in Valdoxan , agomelatine , is an antidepressant .

This is believed to help relieve the symptoms of depression .
Valdoxan might also help to normalise the patient &quot; s sleep patterns .
How has Valdoxan been studied ?
The effects of Valdoxan were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Valdoxan has been compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in five main short-term studies involving a total of 1,893 adults with major depression .
Three of these studies included some patients treated with other antidepressants , either fluoxetine or paroxetine , as an &apos; active comparator . &quot;
The active comparator groups were included to check that the study was able to measure the effectiveness of medicines in treating depression .
The main measure of effectiveness in these five studies was the change in symptoms after six weeks , as measured on a standard scale for depression called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) .
The company also presented the results of a further study comparing Valdoxan with sertraline ( another antidepressant ) .
Two other main studies compared the ability of Valdoxan and placebo to prevent symptoms returning in 706 patients whose depression had already been controlled with Valdoxan .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose symptoms returned during 24 to 26 weeks of treatment .
What benefit has Valdoxan shown during the studies ?
In the short-term studies , Valdoxan was seen to be more effective than placebo in the two studies where no active comparator was used .
In the other three studies , which did include an active comparator , there were no differences in scores between the patients taking Valdoxan and those taking placebo .
However , no effect of fluoxetine or paroxetine was seen in two of these studies , making the results difficult to interpret .
The additional study showed that agomelatine was more effective than sertraline , with a difference in HAM-D scores of 1.68 after six weeks .
In the first of the long-term studies , there was no difference between Valdoxan and placebo in preventing symptoms returning during 26 weeks of treatment .
However , the second study showed that symptoms returned in 21 % of the patients taking Valdoxan over 24 weeks ( 34 out of 165 ) , compared with 41 % of the patients taking placebo ( 72 out of 174 ) .
What is the risk associated with Valdoxan ?
The most common side effects with Valdoxan ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are headache , dizziness , somnolence ( sleepiness ) , insomnia ( difficulty sleeping ) , migraine , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , constipation , upper abdominal pain ( tummy ache ) , hyperhidrosis ( excessive sweating ) , back pain , fatigue ( tiredness ) , increases in liver enzymes and anxiety .
Most side effects were mild or moderate in intensity and happened within the first two weeks of treatment .
Some of these side effects may be linked to the patient &quot; s depression rather than Valdoxan itself .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Valdoxan , see the Package Leaflet .
Valdoxan should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in patients who have problems with their liver , such as cirrhosis ( scarring of the liver ) or active liver disease .
It must also not be used in patients who are taking medicines that slow down the breakdown of Valdoxan in the body , such as fluvoxamine ( another antidepressant ) and ciprofloxacin ( an antibiotic ) .
Valdoxan should not be used in elderly patients with dementia .
Why has Valdoxan been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Valdoxan &quot; s benefits in terms of treating depression might be lower than seen with other antidepressants .
However , since the medicine has a new mode of action , few side effects and a different safety profile to existing antidepressants , the Committee concluded that Valdoxan could be a valuable treatment for some patients as long as their liver function is tested frequently .
Therefore , the CHMP decided that Valdoxan &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults . The Committee recommended that Valdoxan be given marketing authorisation .
2 / 3 Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Valdoxan ?
The company that makes Valdoxan will supply educational material for prescribers of Valdoxan when it is launched .
This material will explain the safety of the medicine , particularly its possible effects on the liver and its interactions with other medicines .

EXTAVIA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Extavia ?
Extavia is a powder and solvent that are made up into a solution for injection .
It contains 250 micrograms ( 8 million international units - MIU ) per millilitre of the active substance interferon beta-1b .
This medicine is the same as Betaferon , which is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) .
The company that makes Betaferon has agreed that its scientific data can be used for Extavia .
What is Extavia used for ?
Extavia is used to treat adult patients who have multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
MS is a disease of the nerves , in which inflammation destroys the protective sheath around the nerves .
This is called &apos; demyelination . &quot;
It is used in patients : • who have experienced the signs of MS ( &apos; demyelination event &quot; ) for the first time , and these are severe enough to justify treatment with injected corticosteroids ( anti-inflammatory medicines ) .
It is used when the patient is considered to be at high risk of developing MS .
Before using it , doctors need to exclude other causes for the symptoms . • who have MS of the type known as &apos; relapsing-remitting , &quot; when the patient has attacks ( relapses ) within periods with no symptoms ( remissions ) , and with at least two relapses within the last two years . • who have secondary progressive MS ( the type of MS that comes after relapsing-remitting MS ) , when their disease is active .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Extavia used ?
Extavia treatment should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of MS .
The treatment should start with 62.5 micrograms ( a quarter of the dose ) every other day , increasing progressively over 19 days to reach the recommended dose of 250 micrograms ( 8 MIU ) given every other day .
Extavia is given by an injection under the skin .
The patients can inject Extavia themselves , provided that they have been trained .

How does Extavia work ?
The active substance in Extavia , interferon beta-1b , belongs to the group &apos; interferons . &quot;
Interferons are natural substances produced by the body to help it fight against attacks such as infections caused by viruses .
The exact way that Extavia works in MS is not yet known but beta-interferon seems to calm down the immune system ( the body &quot; s natural defences ) and prevents the relapses of MS .
Interferon beta-1b is produced by a method known as &apos; recombinant DNA technology . &quot;
The interferon beta-1b is made by a bacterium that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce it .
The replacement interferon beta-1b acts in the same way as naturally produced interferon beta .
How has Extavia been studied ?
Extavia was studied over a two year period in 338 patients with relapsing remitting MS and able to walk unaided , where its effectiveness was compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of relapses .
Extavia has also been studied in 1,657 patients in two studies of secondary progressive MS patients who were able to walk , where it was compared with placebo .
The main measure of effectiveness was the delay to progression of disability .
The study of Extavia in patients with a single demyelinating event involved 487 patients , who received either Extavia or placebo for two years .
The study measured the time it took for a patient to develop clinically defined MS .
What benefit has Extavia shown during the studies ?
In patients with relapsing remitting MS , Extavia was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of annual relapses : patients receiving the medicine had on average 0.84 relapses a year , when patients on placebo had 1.27 relapses .
One of the two studies in patients with secondary progressive MS showed a significant delay in the time to disability progression ( 31 % risk reduction due to Extavia ) and in the time to becoming wheelchair bound ( 39 % ) .
In the second trial , no delay in the time to disability progression was seen .
In both trials , Extavia showed a reduction in the number ( 30 % ) of clinical relapses .
In the study of patients with a single demyelinating event , Extavia was shown to reduce the risk of developing clinically defined MS :
28 % of the patients who received Extavia developed MS , against 45 % of those who received placebo .
What is the risk associated with Extavia ?
Very common side effects with Extavia ( seen more than 1 patients in 10 ) are flu-like symptoms , fever , chills and injection site reactions ( inflammation and pain at the site of injection ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Extavia , see the Package Leaflet .
Extavia should not be used in people who have a history of hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to natural or recombinant interferon beta , human albumin or any of the other ingredients .
Extavia treatment should not be started during pregnancy .
If a woman becomes pregnant while taking the medicine , she should consult her doctor .
Extavia should not be used in patients who are currently suffering from severe depression and / or have thoughts of suicide .
Extavia should not be used in patients who have decompensated liver disease ( when the liver does not function normally ) .
Why has Extavia been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Extavia &quot; s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event , if it is severe enough to justify treatment with intravenous corticosteroids , patients with relapsing-remitting MS and patients with secondary progressive MS with active disease .
They recommended that Extavia be given marketing authorisation .

Questions and answers on the referral for Tritazide tablets containing ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 2.5 / 12.5 mg , 5 / 12.5 mg , 5 / 25 mg
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has completed a review of Tritazide .
The Agency &quot; s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) has concluded that there is a need to harmonise the prescribing information for Tritazide in the European Union and the European Economic Area ( EEA ) .
The review was carried out under an &apos; Article 30 &quot; referral 1 .
What is Tritazide ?
Tritazide contains two active substances , ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide .
Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor .
ACE inhibitors lower the production of angiotensin II , a powerful vasoconstrictor ( a substance that narrows blood vessels ) .
When the production of angiotensin II is lowered , the blood vessels relax and widen .
This allows the heart to pump blood more easily , and the blood flow increases due to more blood being pumped into and through larger passageways .
Hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) is a diuretic .
It works by increasing urine output , reducing the amount of fluid in the blood and lowering the blood pressure .
Tritazide is used in the treatment of hypertension and it is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with ramipril alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone .
Tritazide has been authorised in the EU since 1993 , first in Germany and then in the following countries :
Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia , Slovenia and Sweden .
Tritazide can also be available in the EU and the EEA under other trade names :
Tritace Plus , Triatec Plus , Triatec Comp , Tritace Comp , Tritace Comb , Triatec Composto , Triatec Composto Forte , Cardace Comp , Cardace Plus , Cotriatec , Delix Plus , Ramilich Comp , Tritace HCT , Triatec HCT , Ramipril e Idrocloritiazide , Ramicor D , and Triatec Comp Mite , Hypren Plus , Hypren Plus Forte , Vesdil Plus , Ramipril HCT Zentiva , Unipril Diur , Idroquark ..
The company that markets Tritazide is Sanofi-aventis .
Why was Tritazide reviewed ?
Tritazide is authorised in the European Union ( EU ) via national procedures .
This has led to divergences across member states on the way the medicine can be used , as seen in the differences observed in the Summaries of Product Characteristics ( SPCs ) , labelling and package leaflets in the countries where the product is marketed .
Tritazide has been identified as needing harmonisation by the Co-ordination Group on the Mutual and Decentralised Procedures - Human ( CMD ( h ) ) .

On 18 January 2008 , the European Commission referred the matter to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) in order to harmonise the marketing authorisations for Tritazide in the EU and the EEA .
What are the conclusions of the CHMP ?
The CHMP , in the light of the data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee , was of the opinion that the SPCs , labelling and package leaflets should be harmonised across the EU .
The areas harmonised include :
4.1 Therapeutic Indications
The CHMP noted inconsistencies in the wording of the indication across countries , with terms including &apos; essential hypertension , &quot; &apos; arterial hypertension &quot; and &apos; arterial essential hypertension &quot; being used .
The CHMP highlighted that fact that the indication should be hypertension , and as add-on therapy when each monotherapy has failed .
The combination ramipril 2.5 mg / HCTZ 12.5 mg led to greater reduction in blood pressure than the treatment with individual components and the combination of 5 mg / 25 mg produced a better therapeutic effect than doubling the ramipril dose to 10 mg .
Considering that no major concern can be established concerning the safety , efficacy and clinical adverse event of the ramipril / HCTZ combination in non responders to HCTZ and ramipril alone , the CHMP adopted the following two harmonised wordings for indications : • Treatment of hypertension • This fixed dose combination is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with ramipril alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The CHMP discussed the areas where there was a divergence identified in the dose recommendations .
In most cases the initial recommended dose was the same , but there were differences with respect to subsequent titration ( both in terms of frequency of increase and maximum daily dose ) .
The CHMP also noted that there were limited trial data regarding titration steps with the combination .
The CHMP adopted the harmonised wording :
The dose should be individualised according to the patient profile ( see section 4.4 ) and blood pressure control .
The administration of the fixed combination of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide is usually recommended after dosage titration with one of the individual components .
Tritazide and associated names should be started at the lowest available dosage .
If necessary , the dose can be progressively increased to achieve target blood pressure ; the maximum permitted doses are 10 mg of ramipril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily .
4.3 Contra-indications
The majority of the contraindications are related to use of ramipril as a component of Tritazide .
They are extended with the contraindications of HCTZ .
The CHMP noted that some of the contraindications in local SPCs ( such as acute hypertension or primary aldosteronism ) were in fact non-indications .
The CHMP adopted the following harmonised wording : • Hypersensitivity to the active substance , to any of the excipients or any other ACE ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ) inhibitors ( see section 6.1 ) • History of angioedema ( hereditary , idiopathic or due to previous angioedema wit ACE inhibitors or AIIRAs ( Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists ) ) • Extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces ( see section 4.5 ) • Significant bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a single functioning kidney • 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy ( see section 4.4 and 4.6 ) • Lactation ( see section 4.6 ) Page 2 / 3 • Severe impairment of renal function with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml / min in undialysed patients • Clinically relevant electrolyte disturbances which may worsen following treatment with TRITAZIDE ( see section 4.4 ) • Severe impairment of liver function , hepatic encephalopathy
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
The CHMP included under this session the warning about primary hyperaldosteronism , therefore adopted the following harmonised wording :
The combination ramipril + hydrochlorothiazide does not represent a treatment of choice for primary hyperaldosteronism .
If ramipril + hydrochlorothiazide is used in a patient with primary hyperaldosteronism , then careful monitoring of plasma potassium level is required .
The CHMP included also new warnings for : pregnancy , surgery , electrolyte disturbances , and cough .
4.5 Interactions
The CHMP endorsed the current list of products which interact or may interact with Tritazide , including additional text reinforcing lithium toxicity .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation The CHMP recommended a contra indication only for the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
This is in line with the recommendation of the CHMP &quot; s Pharmacovigilance Working Party on use of ACE inhibitors in pregnancy .
The European Commission issued a decision on 6 March 2009 .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
RECONCILE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report . Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
If you need more information about your animal &quot; s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Reconcile ?
Reconcile is a veterinary medicine containing the active substance fluoxetine .
It is available as chewable tablets containing 8 mg , 16 mg , 32 mg or 64 mg fluoxetine .
What is Reconcile used for ?
Reconcile is used , in combination with behavioural modification techniques , to assist in the treatment of dogs that have behavioural problems ( separation anxiety ) caused by separation from their owners , their normal home , or other dogs .
These behavioural problems might be expressed by excessive barking or howling , inappropriate defecation or urination in the house , or destruction of their surroundings .
Reconcile should not be used on its own but only in dogs that are also undergoing behavioural therapy .
Reconcile tablets are given once a day .
The strength of tablet to be given is based on the dog &quot; s weight , so that the dog is given between 1 to 2 mg per kg of the dog &quot; s bodyweight per day .
The tablets are chewable and may be given either with or without food .
How does Reconcile work ?
The active substance in Reconcile , fluoxetine , is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) .
It works by preventing the neurotransmitter serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord .
Neurotransmitters such as serotonin are chemicals that transfer chemical signals from one nerve cell to another .
Low levels of serotonin in the central nervous system may be associated with depression , anxiety or aggression .
By blocking the re-uptake of serotonin into nerve cells , fluoxetine allows the levels of serotonin to remain higher .
This can improve the clinical signs ( behavioural problems ) of separation-related disorders in dogs .
In order to treat a dog with separation anxiety , the animal should not only receive medicines but also behavioural modification therapy .
Behavioural modification therapy is the most important part of therapy ; however , the use of the medicine allows for a more speedy recovery of the animal patient .
Reconcile has been investigated in four different studies in pet dogs for up to 8 weeks . The effective dose of Reconcile was established in one study . Another study investigated the efficacy of Reconcile in dogs which also received behavioural modification therapy , whilst a 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

In both of those studies the effectiveness of Reconcile was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) for up to 8 weeks .
The last study was conducted under &quot; field conditions &quot; in a large number of dogs that were treated for separation anxiety in various veterinary practices , or clinics , in two European countries .
All dogs received behavioural therapy and were treated either with Reconcile or with clomipramine ( another medicine that can be used to treat dogs with separation-related disorders ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in each of the nine different behaviours recognised as characteristic indicators of separation anxiety in dogs .
In all the studies Reconcile was given once a day , either with or without food .
What benefit has Reconcile shown during the studies ?
The oral administration of Reconcile tablets , as 1 to 2 mg / kg of fluoxetine once a day , is effective for the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs when used in conjunction with behavioural modification therapy .
The efficacy of Reconcile was higher when compared to placebo when behavioural modification therapy was also given to the dogs .
The efficacy was lower when no behavioural modification therapy was given .
When given in combination with behavioural modification therapy , approximately 42 % of dogs given Reconcile improved within one week , compared to only 17 % of the dogs given placebo ( plus the behavioural modification therapy ) .
The fluoxetine-treated group continued to have a higher incidence of improvement over the course of the treatment period and by the end of the 8 weeks , approximately 72 % of the fluoxetine- treated dogs had shown improved behaviour ( a global severity score of 50 % ) .
The field study showed that Reconcile was as effective as clomipramine .
In conjunction with behavioural modification therapy , Reconcile showed significant improvements in treating dogs for barking and inappropriate defecation or urination .
After 8 weeks , two separation anxiety behaviours were significantly improved in the fluoxetine group ( inappropriate defecation and destructive behaviour ) .
Six weeks after the end of treatment , five out of the nine separation anxiety behaviours were still improved in about a third of the treated dogs .
The rate of relapse at the end of the post-treatment phase was slightly higher in the fluoxetine group ( 28 % ) than in the clomipramine group ( 23 % ) .
What is the risk associated with Reconcile ?
The most common side effects with Reconcile are anorexia ( loss of appetite ) and lethargy ( unresponsiveness ) .
Urinary tract disorders ( such as bladder infections , irregular urination and discomfort in passing urine ) and central nervous system signs ( such as incoordination and disorientation ) were also observed .
Less commonly , weight loss / loss of condition , dilation of the pupils of the eye and , rarely , seizures were also observed .
To minimize the risk of adverse reactions , the recommended dose of Reconcile should not be exceeded .
For a full list of all side-effects reported with Reconcile , see the Package Leaflet .
Reconcile tablets should not be used in dogs weighing less than 4 kg , or in dogs with epilepsy or with a history of seizures .
Reconcile should also not be used in dogs that may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to fluoxetine or other SSRIs .
Since Reconcile has not been tested in pregnant or lactating bitches , its use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation .
Reconcile tablets should not be used at the same time as many other medicines , especially medicines that can affect the central nervous system .
See the Package Leaflet for full information .
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
Page 2 / 3 This veterinary medicine has been developed especially for dogs and is not for use in humans .
If a person accidentally takes the medicine , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to a doctor .
Why has Reconcile been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Reconcile exceed the risks when used in combination with behavioural modification techniques as an aid in the treatment of dogs with behavioural problems caused by separation , and recommended that Reconcile be given a marketing authorisation .
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
Other information about Reconcile :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Reconcile to Eli Lilly and Company Ltd on 08.07.2008 .

Introduction and background
On 27 November 2007 , Ireland presented to the EMEA a referral under Article 35 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , concerning all oral soluble powders containing sodium salicylate which are indicated for calves and pigs .
Ireland considered that there was a potentially serious risk to animal health by providing for the authorisation of a potentially ineffective medicine for mass use by farmers , especially when there are several authorised NSAIDs available for individual animal use .
Ireland believed that the use of such a medicine for mass medication could mask the clinical signs of a developing infectious disease which could spread to other animals and thereby pose both an animal health and public health risk .
The referral procedure started on 11 December 2007 and after adoption of a list of questions , the clock was stopped on 15 January 2008 .
Further to the submission of responses to questions , the clock was re-started on 14 March 2008 .
The aim of the assessment was to establish whether marketing authorisations and applications included in the referral procedure should be granted , maintained , suspended , varied or revoked with view to the grounds for referral .
As the procedure concerns a range of products , the assessment has been limited to specific parts of the authorisations in accordance with Article 35 ( 2 ) of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended .
The Marketing Authorisation Holders and Applicant submitted written responses and the clock was re- started on 14 March 2008 .
The clock was stopped again on 14 May 2008 and restarted on 6 June when responses to the outstanding issues where received .
Oral explanations were provided on 15 July 2008 and the CVMP Opinion was adopted on 16 July 2008 .

Discussion
2.1 Questions put to the Marketing Authorisation Holder
The MAHs are requested to provide from the dossier submitted for each country of the EEA where the products are authorised : a ) the Part I Summary of the dossier including SPCs , expert reports and the full composition of the products ; b ) if applicable , Part IV of the application dossier ; c ) an Assessment of the Periodic Safety Update Reports ( PSURs ) in relation to target animal safety and possible lack of efficacy .
Pivotal documents , including the SPC , should be presented in English .
It is known that sodium salicylate when administered by the intravenous route to calves prior to castration failed to attenuate the cortisol response1 . Given this outcome together with published data on the pharmacokinetics of sodium salicylate in calves and significant variation in individual pig concentrations post treatment2 , the MAHs should justify that therapeutic concentrations are established and maintained following oral use of the drug through water medication and submit all available data that could substantiate the posology and dosage regimen of sodium salicylate when given orally to calves and pigs , together with a thorough discussion of the these data .

The MAHs should discuss the benefit / risk balance of the product , with special regard to : • the merits of using sodium salicylate as an oral medication for mass administration in cattle and pigs when individual treatment with parenteral NSAIDs may offer more precise therapy ; • the use for analgesic and antipyretic effects under field condition , bearing in mind that the use in young animals which are suffering disease stress may lead to a potentiation of the undesirable effects of salicylate toxicity .
2.2 Documentation provided
Asprimax 850 mg / g
Chevita Ges m. b . H. submitted all requested parts of the dossier ( Part I and Part IV ) as well as a dose determination study , which was not included in Part IV of the application dossier .
NA-Salicylaat , 100 % , powder for solution for oral administration and NA-Salicylaat , 80 % WSP
Dopharma submitted all requested parts of the dossier ( Part I , Part IV and PSURs ) .
Dopharma also described the history of the product since 1987 , the year of its first authorisation in the Netherlands .
Solacyl 100 % , powder for oral solution for calves and pigs
Eurovet referred to the originator product from Dopharma , Na-salicylaat 100 % , REG NL 8913 .
As a generic product only part I and not part IV of the dossier was submitted .
No PSURs were submitted as the product is not yet marketed .
Solacyl was the subject of an Article 33 Referral , further to the submission of a Decentralised Application .
The CVMP concluded that Solacyl 100 % powder for oral solution was essentially similar to the reference product , Natrium salicylaat 100 % .
Consequently , the same conclusions on efficacy and safety apply to both products .
It was recommended that Solacyl 100 % powder for oral solution for calves and pigs should follow the outcome of the Community Referral according to Article 35 ( 2 ) for sodium salicylate-containing oral soluble powders .
The Commission Decision on the Article 33 referral was adopted on 17 April 2008 .
3 .
Conclusion
Having considered the grounds for referral and the responses provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder and Applicant the CVMP concludes that :
• Therapeutic concentrations are established and maintained following oral use of sodium salicylate in calves and pigs . The dosage required for calves is however 40 mg / kg bodyweight .
• The efficacy of sodium salicylate as supportive treatment when given to calves and pigs was demonstrated in respiratory infections and the usefulness of this compound was clear for the treatment of inflammation in combination with concurrent antibiotic therapy .
• The benefit / risk balance of the product was shown to be positive , however in young animals , the summary of Product Characteristics should state that the product is not to be used in neonates or very young calves of less than 2 weeks of age nor in piglets of less than 4 weeks of age
5 / 9 The following indications have been justified :
4.2 Indications for use , specifying the target species
Pigs : to promote recovery of respiration and to reduce coughing in respiratory tract infections with concurrent antibiotic therapy .
NA-Salicylaat , 100 % , powder for solution for oral administration
Calves : supportive treatment of pyrexia in acute respiratory disease , in combination with appropriate ( e. g. anti-infective ) therapy if necessary .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
3 / 6
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING VERALIPRIDE ( see Annex I )
Veralipride is a benzamide neuroleptic medicine indicated in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
It was first authorised in 1979 and is currently authorised in the EU in Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg and Portugal under the names Agreal and Agradil .
Until June 2005 , veralipride was authorised in Spain .
Following reports of serious side effects affecting the nervous system , the Spanish National Competent Authority concluded that its benefits did not outweigh its potential risks .
Spain therefore withdrew veralipride &quot; s marketing authorisation on 27 June 2005 .
Regulatory actions were also taken in some other EU Member States where the product is authorised and veralipride &quot; s product information was restricted with the aim to reduce the risk of patients developing side effects .
Consequently , the European Commission triggered a referral procedure on 7 September 2006 and requested the CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for products containing veralipride should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn across the European Union following the assessment of these safety risks their impact on the benefit / risk assessment of veralipride .
Efficacy In this review , the CHMP assessed all of the available information on the safety and efficacy of veralipride .
This included mainly 11 studies involving around 600 women , in which veralipride was compared with placebo , and two studies in around 100 women where it was compared with conjugated oestrogens . The CHMP also looked at other small studies .
Based on the submitted data , there appears to be an effect for veralipride in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
The benefit could be qualified as limited , however the effect size cannot be accurately quantified due to methodological deficiencies of available studies ( e. g. in most cases baseline values were not stated , precluding an adequate assessment of the improvement observed ; neither the statistical nor the clinical significance of this effect size could be precisely quantified , as the statistical plan was not clear or was absent ; the presentation of the results was poor ) . In addition , the duration of the trials was too short to allow for proper assessment of maintenance of efficacy .
Few data are available beyond 3 months , mostly in non comparative studies .
The CHMP concluded that the data submitted showed only limited effect of veralipride in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
In addition , the effect size cannot be accurately quantified due to methodological shortcomings and the duration of the trials was too short to allow for proper assessment of maintenance of efficacy .
Safety The 27-year post-marketing period offers a long period of safety profile surveillance .
Neurological adverse events referred to extrapyramidal symptoms and particularly tardive dyskinesias have been reported with veralipride and represent a real concern due to their potential seriousness and irreversibility . It has to be noted that tardive dyskinesias are not predictable and can develop even after the treatment has been discontinued .
Psychiatric adverse events mainly referred to depressive and anxiety states have also been reported with veralipride . Most of them occurred beyond 3 months of treatment .
It should be noted that in the evaluation of the causality assessment of veralipride in the psychiatric events , the role of veralipride is not always clear .
In order to avoid psychiatric AE , extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia , the MAH proposed a maximally allowed duration of 3 months veralipride treatment . However , cases of tardive
4 / 6
dyskinesia have also been reported within the first 3 months of treatment .
The proposal of close monitoring including neurological examination after each 20 day treatment cycle might reduce these risks , but is a measure of considerable burden to both patient and doctor .
As for the other adverse events related with the blockage of the dopamine receptor , especially hyperprolactinemia is a concern .
Veralipride treatment is contra-indicated in patients with prolactin- dependent tumours such as pituitary gland prolactinoma and breast cancer .
But the effect of hyperprolactinemia in women with history of breast cancer is not elucidated .
The proposed intermittent treatment of 20 days , followed by a 10 day period of non-treatment , may temper this effect on the prolactin level , but it is unknown whether this measure has any effect on the adverse event pattern .
Lastly , QT-prolongation is a class-effect of dopamine-antagonists .
The absence of cases of suggestive QT-prolongation in the database is not sufficient to conclude that this effect does not occur with veralipride . No studies were performed to evaluate whether veralipride has an effect on QT .
Benefit / risk In view of the available clinical data the CHMP concluded that the risks associated with the use of veralipride in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause , mainly the neurological reactions ( dyskinesia , extrapyramidal disorder , Parkinson syndrome ) and psychiatric reactions ( depression , anxiety , withdrawal syndrome ) outweigh the limited benefits .
Cases of not predictable and potentially irreversible tardive dyskinesia , as well as early extrapyramidal symptoms , depression , anxiety and withdrawal reactions have been reported with veralipride treatment ; these risks together with the risk of hyperprolactinemia , and the class effect risk on QT- prolongation are considered a concern .
The CHMP took note of the MAH &quot; s proposals , some of which had already been introduced in some countries , in an effort to limit these risks like :
-Restriction of the treatment duration to 3 months in combination with monthly examination in an effort to limit the psychiatric and neurological adverse events .
However , tardive dyskinesia may still occur within the first 3 months of treatment .
-Introduction of the contraindications in patients with Parkinson &quot; s disease , or in combination with other neuroleptics and dopaminergic agonists .
-Introduction of warnings regarding class effects of neuroleptic medicines ( neuroleptic malignant syndrome , QT prolongation , tardive dyskinesia ) and withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety and depressive syndrome .
-Recommendations of medical breast monitoring and intermittent schedule ( 20 days followed by a 10- day period of non-treatment ) to reduce the risk of hyperprolactinemia , aimed to improve the breast safety ( however , it is unknown whether this measure has any effect on the observed adverse event pattern related to hyperprolactinemia like breast enlargement , galactorrhoea and risk for patients with prolactin-dependent tumours such as pituitary gland prolactinoma and breast cancer ) .
Overall , the restriction to limit the use of veralipride to 3 months in combination with monthly medical neurological examinations and breast monitoring is not considered adequate to limit the risk of all adverse effects reported with veralipride and adequately treat the vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause .
In addition , some of these side effects can occur not only during treatment , but also after it is stopped and it is also impossible to predict which women may be at risk .
5 / 6
The CHMP therefore concluded on 19 July 2007 that the benefit / risk balance of veralipride containing medicinal products is not positive under normal conditions of use .
Therefore , the CHMP recommended the withdrawal of all Marketing Authorisations for medicinal products containing veralipride throughout Europe .
GROUNDS FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MA
Whereas
• The Committee considered the referral made under article 31 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , as amended , for medicinal products containing veralipride • The Committee considered that veralipride containing medicinal products only showed limited efficacy in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause ; • The Committee considered that neurological reactions ( dyskinesia , extrapyramidal disorder , Parkinson syndrome ) and psychiatric reactions ( depression , anxiety , withdrawal syndrome ) have been reported with veralipride , including tardive dyskinesia which may be potentially irreversible .
In addition , hyperprolactinemia and the risk of QT prolongation are also concerns ; • The Committee concluded , in view of available data , that the risks associated with the use of veralipride in the treatment of hot flushes associated with the menopause outweigh the limited benefits .
In addition , the Committee considered that the proposed risk minimisation activities were not able to reduce the risks to an acceptable level or predict which women may be at risk ; • The Committee , as a consequence , concluded that the benefit / risk balance of veralipride containing medicinal products is not positive under normal conditions of use .
The CHMP has recommended the withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisations for the medicinal products containing veralipride referred to in Annex I .

Ireland notified the EMEA on 4 July 2007 that the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Veterinary ( CMD ( v ) ) failed to reach an agreement regarding Ecomectin 18.7 mg / g Oral Paste for Horses .
Pursuant to Article 33 ( 4 ) of Council Directive 2001 / 82 / EC , as amended , the matter has been referred to the CVMP .
The referral relates to the concerns raised by Germany that this veterinary medicinal product may present a potential serious risk to public health on the following grounds :
An environmental risk was detected during the risk assessment Phase II Tier A for dung fauna organisms .
No adequate data for Tier B were provided by the applicant to assess the long-term effects on dung fauna organisms caused by the use of the product .
The referral procedure started on 11 July 2007 .
The time frame agreed by the CVMP on 11 July 2007 was 58 days .
On the basis of the grounds for referral , the points considered by the CVMP were :
The Marketing Authorisation Holder should provide complete information submitted to the Reference Member State and the CMD ( v ) in respect to environmental risk assessment ; 2 .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder should provide an updated Environmental Risk Assessment according to the CVMP guidelines on the matter , including any justification for exemption of Phase II ; 3 .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder should discuss and propose , if considered appropriate , possible risk mitigation measures to be included in the SPC of the product .
These points were included in the List of Questions that the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products adopted on 11 July 2007 .
The List of Questions was sent to the Marketing Authorisation Holder .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted written responses to the List of Questions on 12 September 2007 .
Oral explanations were heard on 10 October 2007 .
2 Information in respect to environmental risk assessment
The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided the following information : • An updated Environmental Risk Assessment • The complete information submitted to the Reference Member State and the CMD ( v ) in respect to environmental risk assessment .
6 / 10
2.1 Updated Environmental Risk Assessment according to the CVMP guidelines on the matter , including any justification for exemption of Phase II
The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided an updated environmental risk assessment .
A separate file for justification of exemption from phase II was not specifically given .
However some consideration to this is given on the document that can be summarised as follows :
Ecomectin 18.7 mg / g Oral Paste for Horses is a generic product and as such an environmental risk assessment is now required under Directive 2001 / 82 , as amended .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder considers that the guidelines were written primarily for new molecules where the risk to the environment has not been characterized and that it is not the case for ivermectin-containing veterinary medicinal products that have been in extensive worldwide use for nearly 25 years and that real risk or detrimental environmental effect attributable to ivermectin-based veterinary medicinal products would have been observed .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder considers it inconceivable that the risks posed to the environment associated with the use of Ecomectin 18.7 mg / g Oral Paste for Horses in particular are any greater than those posed by other ivermectin-based products , particularly as the concentration of the active ingredient and the proposed usage regime is identical to that of the reference and other similar products .
The applicant considers that the level of use in horses in terms of animal numbers and dose level , compared to other pasture animals ( cattle and sheep ) is low and that consequently the use in the horse will have limited impact on the environment .
Based on this , the applicant argued that the horse should be classed as &quot; minor use / minor species &quot; and that no Phase II risk assessment is required .
In addition , he considers that since this is a generic , there will not be an additional risk to the environment .
The applicant does not provide a formal justification for exemption of Phase II .
The PEC in soil were calculated for intensively reared animals and pasture animals , according to the CVMP Guideline on Environmental Impact Assessment for Veterinary medicinal Products in Support of the VICH Guidelines GL6 and GL38 ( EMEA / CVMP / ERA / 418282 / 2005-corr ) .
PECSOIL- Intensively reared animals = 1.036 µg. kg-1 PECSOIL- Pasture animals = 0.48 µg. kg-1 For two soil exposure scenarios the PECSOIL values did not exceed the 100 µg / kg threshold value as stated in the VICH Guideline for Phase I assessments of veterinary medicines .
Despite this , Step 16 of the Phase I decision tree would indicate that a Phase II assessment is required for a product of this nature i. e. ecto / endoparasiticide for major species .
The applicability of the following question of the VICH GL6 was considered :
Question 4 - Is the VMP intended for use in a minor species that is reared and treated similarly to a major species for which an EIA ( Environmental Impact Assessment ) already exists ?
7 / 10
The Committee concludes that , since the product is intended for use in a minor species ( horses ) that is reared and treated similarly to a major species , the conclusions on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the major species apply , the product should be exempt from providing a Phase II assessment and that no risk mitigation measures should be included in the SPC of the product .

EN 3 / 8 SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF SURAMOX 15 % LA3
1 .
Introduction Suramox 15 % LA contains amoxicillin which is a beta lactam antibiotic belonging to the group of penicillins .
Amoxicillin was previously evaluated by the CVMP together with other penicillins , in order to establish maximum residue limits ( MRLs ) .
However an ADI for penicillins was not established .
Benzylpenicillin was considered by the Joint FAO / WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) at its 36th meeting in 1990 .
Several cases of allergic reactions in humans following the ingestion of food containing penicillin residues were reviewed .
Reports of further cases , which were not available to JECFA , had also been reported in the published literature .
It was evident that penicillin residues have caused allergic reactions in consumers and that some of these reactions have been serious .
In setting maximum residue limits ( MRLs ) for the penicillins , the CVMP adopted the same approach as the Joint FAO / WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) .
Being aware of cases of allergic reactions at very low doses , JECFA recommended that the daily intake of benzylpenicillin from food be kept as low as practicable , and in any case below 30 µg parent drug per person .
The CVMP set MRLs such that consumer intake from all foods would not exceed this 30 µg threshold .
Thus , the MRLs established by the CVMP for benzylpenicillin were 50 µg / kg for edible tissues .
On this basis MRLs for amoxicillin and other penicillins were proposed by the CVMP , and amoxicillin is currently entered in Annex I of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2377 / 90 , in accordance with the following table :

Assessment of residue depletion studies initially submitted For the referral procedure , the MAH presented one residue study in cattle and one in pigs .
In cattle ten male and ten female ( body weight :
184 ± 24 kg ) were given two intramuscular injections with Suramox 15 % LA at a dose of 15 mg / kg bw ( 1 ml per 10 kg ) .
The first injection was given in the muscles of the left side of the neck , the second injection was given 48 hours later in the right side of the neck .
Injection volumes ranged from 15.0 to 25.9 ml .
Groups of 4 animals ( 2 male and 2 female ) were slaughtered at 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 36 days after the final injection .
At slaughter , the left ( first ) injection site was taken for local tolerance assessment .
In addition , samples were taken from muscle ( mixed sample of hindquarter / forequarter muscle ) , fat ( mixed sample of perirenal / omental fat ) , the entire liver , both kidneys , and the right ( final ) injection site ( approximate dimensions of 10 cm diameter and 6 cm depth ) .
These samples were chilled , homogenised and stored at -80 ° C until analysis 4 to 6 months later ( storage stability confirmed ) .
All samples were analysed for amoxicillin concentrations using an HPLC-UV method with a claimed limit of quantification of 25 µg / kg for all tissues .
3 Or variations of that name as referred to in Annex I EN 4 / 8 The injection sites contained the highest residue concentrations followed by kidney .
In the injection sites , the amoxicillin concentrations were 5822 to 149831 µg / kg at day 1 , below the limit of quantification to 21724 µg / kg at day 7 , below the limit of quantification to 1651 µg / kg at day 14 , below the limit of quantification to 472 µg / kg at day 21 and below the limit of quantification to 162 µg / kg at day 36 .
In pigs ten male and ten female ( bw 42 ± 7 kg ) were given two intramuscular injections with Suramox 15 % LA at a dose of 15 mg / kg bw ( 1 ml per 10 kg ) .
Injection volumes ranged from 2.88 to 5.52 ml .
Groups of 4 animals ( 2 male , 2 female ) were slaughtered at 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 27 days after the final injection .
In addition , samples were taken from muscle ( mixed sample of hindquarter / forequarter muscle ) , skin + fat in natural proportions , the entire liver , both kidneys , and the right ( final ) injection site ( approximate dimensions of 10 cm diameter and 6 cm depth ) .
These samples were chilled , homogenized and stored at -80 ° C until analysis 4 to 6 months later ; the storage stability was confirmed .
All samples were analysed for amoxicillin concentrations using an HPLC-UV method ( HPLC-fluorescence for liver ) with a claimed limit of quantification of 25 µg / kg for all tissues .
However , the residue depletion profile in kidney indicated a non-regular profile .
In the injection sites , the amoxicillin concentrations were 14209 to 109535 µg / kg at day 1 , 358 to 5429 µg / kg at day 7 , 182 to 2816 µg / kg at day 14 , below the limit of quantification to 211 µg / kg at day 21 and below the limit of quantification to 38 µg / kg at day 27 .
In kidney , amoxicillin concentrations were 5446 to 9896 µg / kg at day 1 , 45 to 811 µg / kg at day 7 , below the limit of quantification at day 14 , below the limit of quantification to 180 µg / kg at day 21 and below the limit of quantification to 62 µg / kg at day 27 .
2.1 Calculation of withdrawal periods for Suramox 15 % LA The MAH initially provided residue data in cattle and pigs using the product under consideration at the recommended dose treatment .
The data generated from these studies however , did not allow , at that stage , to establish withdrawal periods for cattle or pigs with the desired level of reliability .
For cattle the injection site was the withdrawal time determining tissue and the residue concentrations of amoxicillin in the injection sites were still above the MRL at the last slaughter time point .
Neither the statistical ( large extrapolation ) nor the alternative approach ( values above the MRL at the last time point ) could be applied to the data provided , and therefore a withdrawal period could not be set according to the &quot; Note for guidance :
Approach towards harmonisation of withdrawal periods &quot; ( EMEA / CVMP / 036 / 95-FINAL ) .
In addition the data were derived from animals weighting approximately 200 kg and receiving only one injection per dose administration , which are not necessarily representative of heavier animals requiring multiple injections .
In addition the analytical method for the determination of the residues was not sufficiently validated .
For pigs of 40-50 kg , it was possible to derive a withdrawal period of 35 days based on injection site residues .
However , the residues in kidney showed an irregular depletion profile and concentrations above the MRL were still observed at the last slaughter time point .
Therefore kidney was considered the tissue determining the withdrawal period .
The data available did not allow establishing a reliable withdrawal period based on residues in kidney by either the statistical or the alternative method .
3 .
Re-examination of the opinion In the detailed grounds for the re-examination of the opinion the MAH argued that the three out of eight kidney samples with amoxicillin concentrations higher than the MRL at 21 and 27 days after the last administration should be considered artefacts because of the abnormal kinetic depletion residue profile .
EN 5 / 8 Whilst the finding of amoxicillin concentrations above the MRL at two time points following the apparent clear result at 14 days could be an artefact , it could equally be argued that it was the results at 14 days that proved unreliable .
Considering that the study was GLP-compliant , the CVMP cannot lightly dismiss the results in question , especially as there were a total of three &apos; positive &quot; samples found .
The MAH further argued that the method used was probably not robust enough and cited a recent publication that mentions the need for deproteinization steps to improve method recovery .
Assuming the MAH has a valid scientific point , and thus the method should have included an additional clean-up step to improve recovery , the weakness of this argument was that all sample results could therefore be understated .
Furthermore , the method provided was validated over a range using fortified samples .
As the validation data fell within accepted specifications , the CVMP could not agree that it was appropriate to simply dismiss the findings above the MRL as artefacts .
The MAH finally argued that the fluorimetric method used was capable of detecting residues of amoxicillin degradation products , and thus , the concentrations reported may have been overestimated .
As a validated method was used with appropriate controls , the CVMP did not consider it appropriate to invalidate the method whilst arguing for its validity for all other results .
4 .
Assessment of new data further to the request for re-consideration by the European Commission One new GLP-study in cattle and two complementary GLP-residue studies in pigs were submitted during the procedure for the reconsideration of the opinion .
Sixteen cattle were slaughtered at 7 , 14 , 46 and 57 days after treatment with Suramox .
Residues in muscle , fat , liver and kidney were below the MRL at all time points .
Residues in the injection sites were high and still up to 5 times above the muscle MRL at the latest time point .
Sixteen pigs were slaughtered at 7 , 14 , 21 and 27 days after treatment with Suramox .
Residues in muscle , fat and liver were below the MRL at all time points .
Residues in kidney ranged from below the limit of quantification to 150 µg / kg at 7 days and were below the limit of quantification at later time points .
Residues at the injection sites were high and still up to 5 times above the muscle MRL at the latest time point .
In a complementary study , eight pigs were slaughtered at 30 and 36 days after treatment with Suramox .
Only residues at the injection sites were investigated .
The results reported indicated residue values below the muscle MRL at all time points except for 1 animal at the last time point , which had a concentration of 6 times above the muscle MRL .
For one animal the result at 30 days was not reported .
5 .
Establishment of the withdrawal period following consideration of all residue studies for pigs and cattle available With the submission of the new residue study for cattle the MAH proposed a withdrawal period of 96 days based on the statistical method .
When providing oral explanations to the Committee concerning the new data submitted the MAH agreed however that withdrawal periods for cattle could not be set on the basis of the data available .
The CVMP concluded that the statistical method could not be used based on the data of the new study provided .
An alternative method could not be used because at the last time point residue concentrations at the injection site were up to 5 times the MRL for muscle .
With the submission of the new residue studies for pigs the MAH proposed a withdrawal period of 38 days based on the two studies provided .
EN 6 / 8 The CVMP noted that the MAH excluded two observations as being outliers when calculating the withdrawal period .
The CVMP concluded that this was not scientifically justified .
The statistical nor the alternative method could be used as at the last time point residues at the injection site were up to 6 times the MRL for muscle .
From the original residue depletion study in pigs , the CVMP concluded that the kidney was the limiting tissue for the establishment of a withdrawal period .
However , taking into account also the two new residue depletion studies in pigs , the CVMP concludes that the totality of the data indicates that the residue depletion at the injection site will determine the withdrawal period .
Therefore withdrawal periods for cattle and pigs could not be recommended .
EN 7 / 8 GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATIONS
Whereas :
- the CVMP considered the referral made under Article 35 of Directive 2001 / 82 / EC in the interest of
the Community regarding consumer safety for national marketing authorisations for Suramox 15 % LA or variations of that name as referred to in Annex I ;
- the CVMP assessed the information provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder in response
to the list of questions agreed by the CVMP , the argumentation provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder in support of the request for the re-examination of the opinion and new residue data made available by the Marketing Authorisation Holder during the re-consideration of the opinion requested by the European Commission ;
- the CVMP considered that based on the residue depletion data provided concerning the depletion
of residues of amoxicillin when administered by injection it was not possible to establish a withdrawal period for cattle and pigs as :
o in cattle , residue concentration at the injection site were still above the MRL at the last slaughter time point ; o in pigs , residue concentrations in kidneys were still above the MRL at the last slaughter time point ;
- the CVMP , having considered the data provided concluded that the currently established
withdrawal periods for cattle and pigs are inadequate to ensure that foodstuffs obtained from the treated animals do not contain residues which might constitute a health hazard to the consumer ; the CVMP recommends the suspension of the marketing authorisations for Suramox 15 % LA or variations of that name as referred in Annex I , presented as injectable suspension for pigs and cattle .
In order to consider lifting the suspension of the marketing authorisations residue depletion data on later time points allowing to establish withdrawal periods for both cattle and pigs meat and offal would be necessary .
In order to ensure a harmonised conclusion on the establishment of the withdrawal periods , it is highly recommended that any new residue depletion studies intended for the lifting of the suspensions of the marketing authorisations are submitted to the CVMP for assessment .

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
5 SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS
OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF IMPLANON
Implanon is a non-biodegradable , long-acting , progestagen-only contraceptive implant inserted subdermally .
The indicated period of use is 3 years .
The implant is a single rod of 4 cm length and 2 mm in diameter and contains 68 mg etonogestrel ( ENG ) dispersed in a matrix of ethylene vinyl acetate ( EVA ) co-polymer .
The ENG dose released by Implanon is equivalent to 60-70 μ g / day shortly after insertion and decreases to about 40 μ g / day at the start of the second year , and to about 25-30 μ g / day at the end of the 3rd year .
The contraceptive action of Implanon is primarily achieved by inhibition of ovulation .
Implanon was approved in the EU during a MR procedure with the Netherlands ( NL ) as reference member state ( RMS ) and has been marketed since 1998 with the indication &quot; contraception . &quot;
The first European renewal of Implanon was successfully completed in 2003 .
In total , about 5 million Implanon implants have been sold worldwide up to July 2008 .
A second European renewal was initiated in September 2007 , in which a majority of EU member states agreed that the benefit / risk profile continues to be positive and supported the recommendation of the RMS to grant another 5-year renewal .
However , a number of concerns were raised by the objecting CMS which did not consider the second renewal acceptable .
The issue was referred to the CMD ( h ) and an assessment was carried out by the RMS .
Because no agreement was reached at Day 60 , the procedure was referred to the CHMP .
The CHMP assessed the dossier and the available data , including the issues raised by the objecting CMS .
The CHMP considered that insertion , migration and removal related events ( collectively known as IRREs ) occur at a low and decreasing frequency .
It is crucial - and should be self evident - that anyone , who performs insertions / removals must be well trained and familiar with those procedures , as incorrect insertions will lead to removal problems .
The CHMP considers that correct insertion is a simple procedure and that the IRRE problems can be prevented or reduced by compliance with updated instructions and training materials .
The MAH was requested to report the results from the active monitoring program for IRREs in the USA .
Because the US AMP does not include the new inserter ( Implanon NXT ) , the MAH is also requested to closely monitor the introduction and performance of the new inserter as a part of the RMP .
The CHMP acknowledged the issue of underreporting but did not consider that any signals indicating an increased risk of breast cancer have been identified .
The difference between the observed and the expected numbers of cases is substantial and is unlikely to be explained by underreporting alone .
Thus , the possibility of an excess risk is not supported by these post-marketing data .
Furthermore , the degree of underreporting is assumed to be lower for Implanon compared to spontaneous ADR reporting in general , therefore the CHMP does not consider that spontaneous reports on breast cancer in users of Implanon give rise to a new signal of an adverse effect .
The information already included in section 4.4 of the SPC is considered sufficient .
The MAH has compiled data of available relevant studies and overall , the epidemiological data on the association between progestogen-only contraception ( POC ) and breast cancer risk are sparse and reflect mostly the use of injectable DMPA .
Thus , most data pertain to injectable POC , little data exist for other POCs , no data are available for Implanon .
It is acknowledged that the available studies have limitations , e. g. the lack of data on the associations with POPs , limited power to examine risk relationships in subgroups , and further no meaningful data to examine the effects of implants .
Of some relevance is the interim analysis data from the ongoing case-control study of the progestogen releasing contraceptive IUD ( Mirena ) ( ICPE meeting report , 2008 ) .
Although Mirena releases levonorgestrel in a very low dose , the data would seem to be relevant also for implants .
This is because Mirena represents a continuous and long-term systemic progestogen exposure in young women .
From the interim analysis , the study hypothesis of an adverse effect on breast cancer risk has no support .
The study includes correction for the age of the study population , enabling comparisons to the Implanon user population and therefore , the final results of this study will be of relevance also for Implanon .
In summary , the CHMP agreed that there is at this time no firm evidence of an association between Implanon exposure and an increased risk of breast cancer in young women .
The final results of the Mirena study were deemed to be of relevance and should contribute to the evaluation of the safety for Implanon .
Furthermore , the reports on Implanon removals in breast cancer patients from the US AMP program are likely to yield
6 valuable information from case series that are expected to be relatively complete . The Mirena study and reports from the US AMP should be included in the updated RMP .
The CHMP is of the opinion that a new epidemiological study of breast cancer in Implanon users is not justified at the present time .
The CHMP considered that bleeding irregularities are expected with all progestogen-only methods , in particular those that inhibit ovulation .
This is well known and sometimes a reason for method discontinuation .
However , although the bleeding pattern often is unpredictable , many women report reduction in episode frequency and total number of bleeding days compared to their normal menstrual pattern .
Almost all women experience a decrease in the total amount of blood loss , even those with an increase in the number of bleeding days .
Thus , many women actually experience a benefit with the bleeding pattern although the lack of predictability may remain a problem for some .
The CHMP considers that bleeding pattern disturbance should not be considered as a serious health issue , as it disappears immediately upon discontinuation and is not associated with any known health risk to the woman .
All experience shows that careful information and counselling before method start as well as support counselling and bleeding diary during use are important for long-term acceptability and compliance .
Similarly , the removal of Implanon due to irregular bleeding should not be regarded as a serious consequence since the &quot; surgical intervention &quot; to remove Implanon must be considered minimal , requiring a 0,5-1cm superficial skin incision , after which the implant can be easily extracted .
The proposal by the MAH to further update bleeding data information in section 4.8 with new US data and to improve the information material on bleeding pattern was endorsed .
The CHMP was of the view that written informed consent in the EU is associated with products where there are established serious risks and that the introduction of a request for informed consent for Implanon , one of several widely used methods of contraception , is unjustified and would strongly signal a risk that is certainly not present .
The main benefit of any contraceptive method is efficacy and the CHMP considered that Implanon shows excellent efficacy with no evidence of decline neither during the 3rd year of use nor in heavy women and that the current text in the SPC regarding efficacy and weight is appropriate .
One contraceptive method will not fulfil all requirements at all times and , therefore , a wide choice of methods appears to be necessary in order for each individual woman to find a method that suits the current needs .
The big advantage of implants is the absence of problems with compliance or gastro-intestinal disturbances that negatively affect contraceptive efficacy versus the disadvantages of irregular bleeding being there with all continuous progestogen-only methods that inhibit ovulation .
The CHMP concluded that the contraceptive efficacy of Implanon is superior to that of other hormonal contraceptives and that the Pearl Indices obtained for Implanon are significantly lower than those obtained with other systemic hormonal contraceptives , and certainly lower than those obtained with combined oral contraceptives , especially as these are prone to non-compliance , and gastro- intestinal disturbances .
In conclusion , the CHMP considers Implanon to be an effective method of contraception with no apparent safety concerns and that the benefit-risk balance of Implanon is positive .
The additional data on this issue that will come from the active monitoring programme in the USA is welcome , in particular the data on efficacy in obese women .
The CHMP , having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that further risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product .
The RMP will be submitted to the RMS within 3 months and will include the activities mentioned in the conditions of the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation .
GROUNDS FOR OPINION
In conclusion , the CHMP considers Implanon to be an effective method of contraception with no apparent safety concerns and is therefore of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of Implanon is positive .
The CHMP agreed on the following proposal for conditions of the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation previously presented by the RMS :
The renewal will be granted for 5 years with the following conditions :
7 The marketing authorisation holder ( MAH ) will continue with the 12 monthly PSURs . The MAH will continue with the 6-monthly reports of all unintended pregnancy and insertion / removal related problems ( IRRE ) during the next 5 year renewal period . With the 6 monthly IRRE report , the MAH will submit the latest results of the ongoing active monitoring program ( AMP ) in the USA . The MAH will submit a type II variation in 2009 to introduce the new Implanon ( Implanon NXT ) .
A RMP proposal for Implanon NXT will be part of this variation . The MAH will develop further information and counselling materials for the Health Care Professionals and the women about the bleeding patterns that may be experienced during use of Implanon , which can be presented to the woman when she is considering use of Implanon for contraception .
Relevant parts of the above mentioned activities should be included in a RMP proposal presented by the MAH within three months .
In addition , the following issues should be included in the RMP proposal :
The body weight at the time of removal will be asked for in case of early removal ( including pregnancy ) in the AMP . An update on bleeding in section 4.8 in the SPC and leaflet as proposed in the draft MAH labelling .

OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF SANOHEX AND ASSOCIATED NAMES ( SEE ANNEX I )
Sanohex is a metered dose aerosol inhaler containing a suspension formulation of salbutamol sulphate 100 µg / spray , with HFA 134a as propellant .
The marketing applications were submitted as hybrid applications under Article 10 ( 3 ) of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC and the EU reference product is Sultanol Dosier-Aerosol 100 μ g / dose , Druckgasinhalation , suspension , ( GlaxoSmithKline ) .
The reference product in SE is Ventoline Evohaler , 0.1 mg / dose ( GlaxoSmithKline AB ) .
The indication sought is &quot; Symptomatic treatment of bronchoconstriction due to bronchial asthma , chronic bronchitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and emphysema .
Prophylaxis of exercise and allergen induced asthma . &quot; The Applicant submitted pharmaceutical and clinical efficacy and safety documentation , but a number of Member States did not consider the product to be approvable based on the submitted in vitro data only .
Major objections were raised and because the main issues on quality ( in vitro equivalence to the reference product ) and the insufficiency of the clinical studies could not be resolved , the procedure was referred to CHMP by a number of objecting concerned member states .
Critical Evaluation
The CHMP adopted a List of Questions summarising a number of unresolved issues to be addressed and substantiated by the Applicant .
Following the assessment of the Applicants response to the CHMP List of Questions , the CHMP considered that the presented answers did not support the comparability of the Applicant &quot; s product to the reference product .
The supplied data on particle size distribution did not allow the prediction of the lung deposition pattern affecting clinical efficacy and safety and the aerodynamic particle size distribution differed significantly between the two products .
The CHMP concluded that the applied product had not shown enough similarity to the reference product to establish therapeutic equivalence with regards to efficacy and safety and therefore adopted a list of seven Outstanding Issues to be addressed by the Applicant .
Question 1- The Applicant should provide the protocol of the in vitro comparisons of the particle size distributions in dry conditions , humid conditions and with spacer where all the relevant information should have been pre-specified , e. g. objective , sample size required to demonstrate equivalence in the predefined pools of stages within a pre-specified acceptance range , the pre-specified batches and the pre-specified statistical methods .
Similarly , the final report of the three comparisons should be provided indicating the study dates , the raw data and the study results with its corresponding QA certificate .
The Applicant stated that no protocol was established before the in vitro comparison but that in house documents with pre-specified criteria were used and that test product batches were subjected to release and stability testing according to protocols from the quality control department .
The Applicant provided single issue specific protocols for test and generic products , demonstrating that the approach for demonstration of in vitro equivalence followed a planned and sound concept .
In addition , the Applicant provided a consolidated final protocol consisting of all single protocols retrospectively combined and a retrospectively combined report from all the corresponding study reports including the raw data and study results .
The CHMP noted the Applicant response , but considered that the data was not analysed according to the methodological requirements for clinical comparison .
The new formal protocol of the performed retrospective analysis and the new final report on the in vitro data indicated that the 90 % CI remained outside the 15 % or 20 % acceptance range for stage 0 , stage 1 and stage 2 and within the 20 % CI but outside the 15 % CI for stage 3 the 90 % CI .
The CHMP did not agree that this amount of drug is too small to be relevant and could furthermore not support the Applicant claim that stage 1 is related only to safety .
The pooling method used and the addition of the spacer is likely to mask differences in quality between the two products .
Therefore the CHMP considered in vivo data to be necessary to confirm therapeutic equivalence .
4 Question 2 - The Applicant &apos;s justification of the selected pooling of stages is not acceptable .
The Applicant should justify :
a .
Why the comparison of all the individual stages is not more discriminative to detect differences between formulations that may have clinical relevance b .
Why the particles of 6 µm or up to 8 µm , which are deposited in stage 1 , are considered with regards to safety only. c .
The Applicant should discuss why the ranges of particles that are deposited in the large conducting intrathoracic airways are pooled instead of investigating them with the highest accuracy and precision in the large possible number of categories ( stages ) .
The Applicant provided in vitro data to demonstrate the in vitro equivalence between the test product and the reference product and presented justifications for the pooling of the data including a second pooling using the following grouped stages :
Throat separately ( oropharyngeal deposition and hence swallowed dose ) , Pooling 1 :
Stage 0 , 1 , and 2 ( large non respirable particles deposited in upper airway , which can be ignored as clinically insignificant ) , Pooling 2 :
Stage 3 , 4 and 5 ( fine particle dose ( FPD ) between 1.1 and 4.5 µm , deposited on bronchi and predictive of the in vivo bronchodilator efficacy and of Cmax ( early lung bioavailability ) ) and Pooling 3 :
Stage 6 , 7 , and Filter ( reflects extra fine particles deposited in alveoli ) .
Particles &gt; 4.5 µm are swallowed and contribute by negligible amount to the early systemic bioavailability ( as Cmax ) and peak adverse events of inhaled salbutamol .
The Applicant stated that the presented in vitro data can be predictive of pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for Cmax and for peak airway and systemic beta-2 adrenoceptor mediated responses , which are mainly determined by lung bioavailability .
a ) The Applicant quoted the EMEA draft guideline on orally inhaled products ( OIP ) which offers the possibility to pool different stages of the Andersen Cascade Impactor .
The particle size is considered to be one of the most significant characteristic influencing deposition in the respiratory tract and can be determined using Cascade Impactor measurements although the in vitro comparison should be performed per impactor stage or justified grouped stages which are relevant to efficacy and safety .
The reason for stage pooling is to become discriminative in terms of lung deposition and the measurement of particle size with an instrument such as an impactor is a way to obtain information on particle size of the aerosolized medication and the particle size distribution .
The amount of salbutamol depositing in the lung or in certain regions of the lung has clinical relevance and therefore single stages of the impactor represent a certain particle size or a size-range which correlates to the site of deposition .
However , for some substances , clinical efficacy and safety is not represented by a specific stage but a range of stages and therefore , comparison of individual stages cannot detect differences between formulations that may have clinical relevance .
b ) The Applicant indeed considered that it is the amount of respirable particles &lt; 4.7 µm that will ultimately determine bronchodilator efficacy , particularly for stages 3 / 4 / 5 ( i. e. particle size 1.1-4.7 µm ) which correspond to bronchial deposition where the airway smooth muscle beta-2 adrenoceptors are located .
The amount of salbutamol impacted on stages comprising throat / 0 / 1 / 2 are non respirable ( i. e . &gt; 4.7 µm ) and will correspond to larger particles deposited on the oropharynx ( throat stage ) and upper airway ( stages 0 / 1 / 2 ) .
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that the swallowed fraction from oropharyngeal depositions contributes a negligible amount to the early systemic bioavailability and peak adverse effects of inhaled salbutamol and that there is only negligible direct absorption from the oropharynx .
c ) Pooling of stages is justified based on safety and efficacy , taking into account the particularities of salbutamol and its site of action .
According to the Applicant , a comparison of the results for the different approaches ( individual stages 3 , 4 and 5 versus pooled stages 3 / 4 / 5 ) demonstrates that except for stage 3 ( below the -15 % limit ) , both approaches lead to comparable results .
The difference for stage 3 amounts to a mean difference of only 3.27 % ( i. e .
38.17 µg ) of the pooled fine particle dose for stages 3 / 4 / 5 .
This difference is not expected to be of clinical relevance and the two products are therefore considered to exhibit
5 an equivalent bronchodilator response . The Applicant concluded that the in vitro data and the negligible clinical relevance of the differences detected were supported by the provided in vivo study .
The CHMP noted the position of the Applicant but considered that this oversimplifies the effect of all generated particles on the respiratory and alimentary tract and that it is difficult to define the role of the individual stages in terms of safety and efficacy , effects such as differences in breathing patterns , aerosol velocity in entering the airways and the shape of the plume must be taken into account .
Furthermore , the CHMP did not agree that particles larger then 6 µm are not relevant for the demonstration of efficacy , as even such large particles may penetrate to the peripheral airways .
The in-vitro data without spacer suggests inferiority in stages 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 and similarity for stages 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and the filter stage , which suggests a similar Cmax and a superior AUC or similar AUC if the small amount in stages 0 / 1 / 2 were negligible .
The in vivo bioequivalence study shows an equivalent but statistically significant superiority for the test product for Cmax and a shorter Tmax , indicating that the test product has a slightly higher peripheral deposition .
Therefore , the different cloud size / shape or the humid environment that exists in the respiratory tree may be relevant .
The in vitro tests performed in humid environment show non- equivalence due to superiority in the stages with the finest particles both separately and after pooling .
Question 3 - The Applicant &apos;s justification to widen the acceptance range taken from the draft guideline is not acceptable .
The Applicant should provide evidence based on sensitive clinical studies ( preferably studies investigating the relative potency ) that a 20 % difference lacks of clinical relevance .
The Applicant stated that for pharmacokinetic studies , equivalence is conventionally demonstrated by applying a + / - 20 % limit for the 90 % CI and therefore applied these limits to the FDP comparison , despite the recent EMEA guidance recommending + / - 15 % limits for in vitro equivalence and + / - 20 % limits for in vivo pharmacokinetic equivalence .
The Applicant considered that the widening of the limits to + / - 20 % is justifiable and demonstrated that the results obtained fall within the + / - 15 % range , except for stage 3 .
For stages representing extra fine particles ( &lt; 1.1µm ) , equivalence was also shown , with the exception of deposition in the filter stage ( outside + 15 % but within + 20 % ) .
In absolute terms , the values outside the + / - 20 % limit represent a negligible mean difference which is clinically irrelevant in the context of any overall potential increase in systemic exposure .
Based on the draft OIP guideline , the Applicant initiated two parmacokinetic studies , both with a single dose administration of 800 µg salbutamol in healthy volunteers : studies 2007-59-DOS-5 ( systemic safety study ) and 2007-76-DOS-6 ( pulmonary deposition study ) .
As seen in the interim analysis , the intra-subject variability for the pulmonary deposition study is about twice as high as for the systemic safety study , demonstrating that variability increases when only pulmonary deposition is assessed .
The Applicant considered that the results from study 2007-59-DOS-5 demonstrate bioequivalence in terms of rate and extent of the total systemic absorption of inhaled salbutamol .
Based on the submitted expert report from study 2007-76-DOS-6 , the Applicant concluded that &quot; the presented in vitro data for fine particle dose and the in vivo data for lung bioavailability as Cmax clearly point to the presence of therapeutic equivalence within the 20 % limits for both airway and systemic beta-2 adrenoceptor mediated peak effects .
Moreover , the in vitro data for larger particle deposition together with the total ( lung + gut ) systemic bioavailability as AUC show evidence of overall systemic equivalence .
On the basis of these data the two formulations are considered to exhibit an equivalent therapeutic ratio and to be clinically interchangeable . &quot;
The CHMP stated that the draft guideline proposed a more conservative approach to the applied acceptance range mainly due to lack of experience in this filed and the fact that pooling may mask the differences in the evaluated products , as is the case for the current product .
The CHMP was of the opinion that the bioequivalence study ( 2207-59-DOS-5 ) demonstrated equivalency in safety profile when used without a spacer , as well as similar Cmax and Tmax values .
Question 4 - Raw data of the comparison with spacer have not been provided and neither the raw data nor results in humid conditions have been provided and discussed .
6 The Applicant provided raw data obtained under humid condition clearly demonstrating that the aerodynamic characteristic of salbutamol sulphate particles do not change under humid conditions .
In addition , because two clinical studies are submitted for demonstration of in vivo equivalence and for confirming the in vitro data , the in vitro results obtained under humid condition become less important .
The Applicant also decided to generate additional spacer data in order to obtain more reliable information on the particle size distribution when the compared inhalers are fitted with their respective spacer devices .
The data clearly shows that the spacer induces a significant depletion of large particles in the throat and an increase in fine particle dose ( &lt; 5 µm particles ) , with the confidence intervals for the single impactor stages within the + / - 20 % limit , except for stage 0 .
The Applicant considered that the overall data demonstrate that spacer use results in the same high extent of in vitro equivalence as inhaler testing without this device .
The CHMP noted the inclusion of the requested raw data but considered that the results did not demonstrate similarity in all stages and that it was therefore difficult to conclude on therapeutic equivalence .
The CHMP requested the Applicant to provide data from a PK study with concomitant use of a spacer .
Question 5 - The Applicant should justify why the product is considered equivalent when the particle size comparison with spacer is not able to demonstrate equivalence in the pool of throat + stage 0 + stage 1 , pooled as desired by the Applicant with the 20 % acceptance range and pool of stages 2 + 3 , as desired by the Applicant , with the 15 % acceptance range , mainly because the sample size of this comparison has not been calculated appropriately .
Following an additional request for clinical spacer studies , the Applicant decided to extend the previously submitted in vitro equivalence study with spacer use , including 7 generic and 10 reference batches ( compared to 2 and 3 previously ) .
The equivalence limits were set at 80 - 125 % .
For stages with a small deposition of particles and a relatively high standard deviation it is particularly critical to reach a confidence interval within the defined limits .
Single stage comparison revealed that most of the values are within the ± 15 % range ( except from stage 0 , 1 and filter ) and after pooling , all values were within the ± 15 % range .
The fine particle dose ratio was 1.01 and the corresponding confidence interval was 0.97 - 1.04 and the data therefore clearly demonstrate that the expected spacer effect is identical for test and reference product .
The Applicant also included results from a comparative pharmacokinetic study evaluating systemic safety , which demonstrates equivalence and considered that the equivalence of the Cmax values as identified from the systemic safety study supports the prediction of equivalent lung bioavailability and equivalent lung deposition .
The CHMP noted the additional data but remained of the opinion that the pooling method masked the differences between the test products and that in addition , the used spacer decreased the amount of the larger particles and increased the amount of fine particles .
Although the claim of the Applicant that the PK bioequivalence study demonstrated equivalence without spacer was endorsed , the CHMP did not support the assumption that the data with the use of a spacer would provide the same evidence of equivalence and therefore considered that a PK study with a spacer is mandatory .
Question 6 - The first part of question 5 of the LoQ , &quot; The Applicant should discuss the storage stability of the product , in light of studies demonstrating that the inverted and lying orientations of the device are the most stable &quot; has not been fully answered , since only discussions about upright and lying position , but not about inverted orientation has been submitted .
The Applicant is required to present this discussion .
Regarding the storage stability , the Applicant complemented the already submitted repriming study with comparative data from inverted storage and found that all investigated shots for the generic product comply with the specified delivered dose up to a storage period of 7 days .
The undesirable reflow from suspension formulation into the canister does not occur if the cans are stored in an inverted or lying position but may occur if the inhaler is stored in an upright position .
The results provided as a whole clearly indicate the non inferiority of the generic product to the reference product and the Applicant considered both products to be fully interchangeable .
During drug product development , the Applicant optimised the applicator , modifying the shape of the device to make it possible to store the applicator in the two identified required storage orientations .
The functionality of the applicator is not affected and therefore the aerosol cloud and the
7 aerodynamic particle size distribution remain the same . The CHMP acknowledged the improved device design and agreed with the Applicant response , the issue was considered resolved .
Question 7 - In order to complete the comparative study between the reference and the test products , a comparative repriming study after storage at lying position ( 0 ° C ) ( initial stage of can life and partially emptied can ) should be carried out to confirm their similarity of behaviour .
As stated earlier , the Applicant provided initial repriming studies on the test product which were complemented with a repriming study with the reference product and the CHMP considered that while the data demonstrate the effect of the position of the MDI on the deposited dose , this effect is observed in both the test and the reference product .
Therefore , the CHMP concluded that the products should be considered as interchangeable .
Conclusion of the assessment of the Applicant response to the List of Outstanding Issues
In conclusion , the CHMP considered that the Applicant responses to the List of Outstanding Issues did allow the committee to conclude that the test and the reference product are similar when used without a spacer , with regards to safety aspects .
However , equivalence between the test and reference products has still not been fully demonstrated although this may be addressed by submitting an analysis of the data from the ongoing study 2007-76-DOS-6 , the CHMP addressed two outstanding issues to be discussed by the Applicant during an oral explanation :
1 .
The Applicant should provide in vivo equivalence when the products are used with and their spacers 2 .
A comparison between reference and test products pulmonary deposition should be addressed ( Study 2007-76-DOS-6 )
The Applicant responded to the outstanding issues during an Oral Explanation held during the November CHMP meeting .
The Applicant was able to present data from the pulmonary deposition study ( Study 2007- 76-DOS-6 ) were presented and interpreted and this new in vitro data ( without spacer in a normal and humid environment and with spacer in a normal environment ) suggested a similar particle size distribution between the test and the reference product .
The pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study also confirmed that both products possess the same systemic safety profile since bioequivalence in systemic levels ( AUC and Cmax ) have been shown .
In addition , the study demonstrated indirectly the same lung deposition with a trend to a deeper lung deposition based on a higher ratio in Cmax and a shorter Tmax .
In the opinion of the CHMP , this small difference is not expected to be clinically significant and a pharmacodynamic study does not seem to be required .
8 GROUNDS FOR POSITIVE OPINION
The CHMP was of the opinion that based on the totality of the data submitted , including the data from the pulmonary deposition study ( Study 2007-76-DOS-6 ) , a similar particle size distribution between the test and the reference product could be demonstrated .
The pharmacokinetic bioequivalence data also confirmed that Sanohex and the reference product possess the same systemic safety profile since bioequivalence in systemic levels ( AUC and Cmax ) have been shown , when used with or without a spacer .
In conclusion a Potential Serious Risk to Public Health was no longer identified and the CHMP concluded that the products are bioequivalent and that the benefit-risk ratio is positive .
Whereas
- the CHMP considered that a similar particle size distribution between the test and the reference product was
demonstrated ,
- the CHMP considered that Sanohex and the reference product possess the same systemic safety profile , as
demonstrated by the bioequivalence in systemic levels ( AUC and Cmax ) ,
- the CHMP concluded that the products are bioequivalent and that the benefit-risk ratio is positive ,

SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1 .
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg / ml eye drops , solution
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One ml of solution contains 0.3 mg bimatoprost .
Excipient : benzalkonium chloride 0.05 mg / ml .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Eye drops , solution .
Colourless to slightly yellow solution .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension ( as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye ( s ) once daily , administered in the evening .
The dose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect .
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used , each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart .
Use in children and adolescents ( under the age of 18 ) :
LUMIGAN has only been studied in adults and therefore its use is not recommended in children or adolescents .
Use in hepatic and renal impairment :
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients .
In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal ALT , AST and / or bilirubin at baseline , LUMIGAN had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 months .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
2 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Before treatment is initiated , patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth , darkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation since these have been observed during treatment with LUMIGAN .
Some of these changes may be permanent , and may lead to differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated .
The change in iris pigmentation occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for several months .
At 12 months , the incidence was 1.5 % and did not increase following 3 years treatment .
LUMIGAN contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride , which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses .
Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration .
Benzalkonium chloride , which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products , has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Since LUMIGAN contains benzalkonium chloride , monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients or where the cornea is compromised .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function and should therefore be used with caution in such patients .
In clinical studies , in those patients with a history of a compromised respiratory function , no significant untoward respiratory effects have been seen .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or uncontrolled congestive heart failure .
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions , neovascular , inflammatory , angle-closure glaucoma , congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma .
Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) following treatment with LUMIGAN and should therefore be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema ( e. g. aphakic patients , pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
No interactions are anticipated in humans , since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low ( less than 0.2 ng / ml ) following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways , and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies ..
In clinical studies , LUMIGAN was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions .
Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women .
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses ( see section 5.3 ) .
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
3 Lactation It is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human milk , however , this substance is excreted in rat milk after intravenous administration .
It is recommended that LUMIGAN is not used in nursing mothers .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
As with any ocular treatment , if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical studies , over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN .
On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN usage , the most frequently reported treatment- related adverse events were : growth of eyelashes in up to 45 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7 % at 2 years and 2 % at 3 years , conjunctival hyperaemia ( mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature ) in up to 44 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13 % at 2 years and 12 % at 3 years and ocular pruritus in up to 14 % of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 3 % at 2 years and 0 % at 3 years .
Less than 9 % of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations being 3 % at both 2 and 3 years .
The following undesirable effects definitely , probably or possibly related to treatment were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN . Most were ocular , mild to moderate , and none was serious :
With each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness
Infections and infestations Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : infection ( primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections )
Nervous system disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : headache Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : dizziness
Eye disorders Very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) : conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes , ocular pruritus
Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : allergic conjunctivitis , asthenopia , blepharitis , cataract , conjunctival oedema , corneal erosion , eye discharge , eyelash darkening , eye pain , foreign body sensation , increased iris pigmentation , ocular burning , ocular dryness , ocular irritation , photophobia , superficial punctate keratitis , tearing , visual disturbance and worsening of visual acuity
Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : blepharospasm , cystoid macular oedema , eyelid retraction , iritis , retinal haemorrhage , uveitis .
Vascular disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : hypertension
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : eyelid erythema , eyelid pruritus , pigmentation of periocular skin Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : eyelid oedema , hirsutism .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : asthenia , peripheral oedema
4 Investigations Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : liver function test abnormal
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported , and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration .
If overdosage occurs , treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .
If LUMIGAN is accidentally ingested , the following information may be useful : in two-week oral rat and mouse studies , doses up to 100 mg / kg / day did not produce any toxicity .
This dose expressed as mg / m2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN in a 10 kg child .

The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow .
Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours .
The duration of effect is maintained for at least 24 hours .
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent .
It is a synthetic prostamide , structurally related to prostaglandin F2α ( PGF2α ) , that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors .
Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides .
The prostamide receptor , however , has not yet been structurally identified .
During 12 months &quot; monotherapy treatment , versus timolol , mean change from baseline in morning ( 08 : 00 ) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mm Hg .
At any visit , the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg .
In a 6-month clinical study , versus latanoprost , a statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP ( ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus - 6.0 to - 7.2 mmHg for latanoprost ) was observed at all visits throughout the study .
Conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes , and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with latanoprost , however , the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically significant difference .
Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone , adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and bimatoprost lowered mean morning ( 08 : 00 ) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg .
Limited experience is available with the use in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma , and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy .
No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials .
5 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro .
After ocular administration , the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time .
After once daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.03 % bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks , blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection ( 0.025 ng / ml ) within 1.5 hours after dosing .
Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng / ml and 0.09 ng • hr / ml respectively , indicating that a steady drug concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 l / kg .
In human blood , bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma .
The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 % .
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation , N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites .
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion , up to 67 % of an intravenous dose administered to healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine , 25 % of the dose was excreted via the faeces .
The elimination half-life , determined after intravenous administration , was approximately 45 minutes ; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l / hr / kg .
Characteristics in elderly patients :
After twice daily dosing , the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 ng • hr / ml bimatoprost in the elderly ( subjects 65 years or older ) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng • hr / ml in young healthy adults .
However , this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing .
There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use .
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥ 0.03 % daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and / or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure .
The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in melanocyte number .
No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed , and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown .
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies .
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg / kg / day ( approximately 103-times the intended human exposure ) .
In embryo / foetal developmental studies abortion , but no developmental effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the dose in humans , respectively .
These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher , respectively , than the intended human exposure .
In rat peri / postnatal studies , maternal toxicity caused reduced gestation time , foetal death , and decreased pup body weights at ≥ 0.3 mg / kg / day ( at least 41-times the intended human exposure ) .
Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not affected .

Further information
WHAT LUMIGAN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
LUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation .
It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides .
LUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye .
This high pressure can lead to a disease called glaucoma .
If the high pressure is not reduced , it could eventually damage your sight .
Your eye contains a clear , watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye .
Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this .
If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough , the pressure inside the eye builds up .
LUMIGAN works by increasing the amount of liquid that is drained .
This reduces the pressure inside the eye .
LUMIGAN may be used on its own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure .
BEFORE YOU USE LUMIGAN
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of LUMIGAN .
Take special care with LUMIGAN :
- Talk to your doctor , if :
- - -
You have any breathing problems .
You have liver or kidney problems . You have had a cataract surgery in the past
LUMIGAN may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow , and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too .
The colour of your iris may also go darker over time .
These changes may be permanent .
The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye .
People under 18 must not use LUMIGAN .
19 Using other medicines : Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , or have recently taken , any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
If you use LUMIGAN with another eye drop , leave at least five minutes between putting in LUMIGAN and then the other drops .

GANFORT 300 micrograms / ml + 5 mg / ml eye drops , solution
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One ml of solution contains 0.3 mg of bimatoprost and 5 mg of timolol ( as 6.8 mg of timolol maleate ) .
Contains benzalkonium chloride 0.05 mg / ml .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Eye drops , solution .
Colourless to slightly yellow solution .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Recommended dosage in adults ( including the elderly )
The recommended dose is one drop of GANFORT in the affected eye ( s ) once daily , administered in the morning .
If one dose is missed , treatment should continue with the next dose as planned .
The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye ( s ) daily .
If more than one topical ophthalmic product is to be used , the different products should be instilled at least 5 minutes apart .
Use in renal and hepatic impairment
GANFORT has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment . Therefore caution should be used in treating such patients .
Use in children and adolescents
GANFORT has only been studied in adults and therefore its use is not recommended in children or adolescents .
4.3 Contraindications
Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Sinus bradycardia , second or third degree atrioventricular block , overt cardiac failure , cardiogenic shock .
2 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents , GANFORT may be absorbed systemically .
No enhancement of the systemic absorption of the individual active substances has been observed .
Due to the beta-adrenergic component , timolol , the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-blockers may occur .
Cardiac failure should be adequately controlled before beginning GANFORT therapy .
Patients with a history of severe cardiac disease should be watched for signs of cardiac failure and have their pulse rates checked .
Cardiac and respiratory reactions , including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma , and , rarely , death in association with cardiac failures have been reported following administration of timolol maleate .
Beta-blockers may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism and cause worsening of Prinzmetal angina , severe peripheral and central circulatory disorders and hypotension .
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients ( especially those with labile diabetes ) as beta-blockers may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia .
While taking beta-blockers , patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be unresponsive to the usual dose of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions .
In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and / or bilirubin at baseline , bimatoprost had no adverse reactions on liver function over 24 months .
There are no known adverse reactions of ocular timolol on liver function .
Before treatment is initiated , patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth , darkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation since these have been observed during treatment with bimatoprost and GANFORT .
Some of these changes may be permanent , and may lead to differences in appearance between the eyes if only one eye is treated .
After discontinuation of GANFORT , pigmentation of iris may be permanent .
After 12 months treatment with GANFORT , the incidence of iris pigmentation was 0.2 % .
After 12 months treatment with bimatoprost eye drops alone , the incidence was 1.5 % and did not increase following 3 years treatment .
Cystoid macular oedema has been reported with GANFORT .
Therefore , GANFORT should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema ( e. g. aphakic patients , pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule ) .
The preservative in GANFORT , benzalkonium chloride , may cause eye irritation .
Contact lenses must be removed prior to application , with at least a 15-minute wait before reinsertion .
Benzalkonium chloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses .
Contact with soft contact lenses must be avoided .
Benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Therefore monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use of GANFORT in dry eye patients or where the cornea is compromised .
GANFORT has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions , neovascular , inflammatory , angle-closure glaucoma , congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma .
3 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
There is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension , and / or marked bradycardia when eye drops containing timolol are administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers , guanethidine , or beta-blocking agents , anti-arrhythmics , digitalis glycosides or parasympathomimetics .
Beta-blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic agents .
Beta-blockers can mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta-blockers .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of GANFORT in pregnant women .
Bimatoprost No adequate clinical data in exposed pregnancies are available .
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses ( see section 5.3 ) .
Timolol Epidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but shown a risk for intra uterine growth retardation when beta-blockers are administered by the oral route .
In addition , signs and symptoms of beta-blockade ( e. g. bradycardia , hypotension , respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia ) have been observed in the neonate when beta-blockers have been administered until delivery .
If GANFORT is administered until delivery , the neonate should be carefully monitored during the first days of life .
Animal studies with timolol have shown reproductive toxicity at doses significantly higher than would be used in clinical practice ( see section 5.3 ) .
Consequently , GANFORT should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Lactation Timolol is excreted in breast milk .
It is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk but it is excreted in the milk of the lactating rat .
GANFORT should not be used by breast-feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
GANFORT has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
As with any ocular treatment , if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects
No adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) specific for GANFORT have been observed in clinical studies .
The ADRs have been limited to those earlier reported for bimatoprost and timolol .
The majority of ADRs were ocular , mild in severity and none were serious .
Based on 12-month clinical data , the most commonly reported ADR was conjunctival hyperaemia ( mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature ) in approximately 26 % of patients and led to discontinuation in 1.5 % of patients .
The following ADRs were reported during clinical trials with GANFORT ( within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness ) :
4 Nervous system disorders Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : headache
Eye disorders Very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) : conjunctival hyperaemia , growth of eyelashes .
Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : superficial punctuate keratitis , corneal erosion , burning sensation , eye pruritus , stinging sensation in the eye , foreign body sensation , eye dryness , eyelid erythema , eye pain , photophobia , eye discharge , visual disturbance , eyelid pruritus .
Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : iritis , eye irritation , conjunctival oedema , blepharitis , epiphora , eyelid oedema , eyelid pain , visual acuity worsened , asthenopia , trichiasis .
Not known : cystoid macular oedema .
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : rhinitis
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) : blepharal pigmentation Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) : hirsutism
Additional adverse events that have been seen with one of the components and may potentially occur also with GANFORT :
Bimatoprost Infections and infestations : infection ( primarily colds and upper respiratory symptoms ) .
Nervous system disorders : dizziness Eye disorders : allergic conjunctivitis , cataract , eyelash darkening , increased iris pigmentation , blepharospasm , eyelid retraction , retinal haemorrhage , uveitis .
Vascular disorders : hypertension .
General disorders and administration site condition : asthenia , peripheral oedema .
Investigations : liver function tests ( LFT ) abnormal .
Timolol Psychiatric disorders : insomnia , nightmares , decreased libido Nervous system disorders : dizziness , memory loss , increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis , paresthaesia , cerebral ischaemia Eye disorders : decreased corneal sensitivity , diplopia , ptosis , choroidal detachment ( following filtration surgery ) , refractive changes ( due to withdrawal of miotic therapy in some cases ) , keratitis .
Ear and labyrinth disorders : tinnitus .
Cardiac disorders : heart block , cardiac arrest , arrhythmia , syncope , bradycardia , cardiac failure , congestive heart failure .
Vascular disorders : hypotension , cerebrovascular accident , claudication , Raynaud &quot; s phenomenon , cold hands and feet , palpitation .

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : alopecia , psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis .
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : systemic lupus erythematosus .
Renal and urinary disorders :
Peyronie &quot; s disease .
General disorders and administration site conditions : oedema , chest pain , fatigue .
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported , and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration .
Bimatoprost If GANFORT is accidentally ingested , the following information may be useful : in two-week oral rat and mouse studies , doses of bimatoprost up to 100 mg / kg / day did not produce any toxicity .
This dose 5 expressed as mg / m2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of GANFORT in a 10 kg child .
Timolol Symptoms of systemic timolol overdose are : bradycardia , hypotension , bronchospasm , headache , dizziness , shortness of breath , and cardiac arrest .
A study of patients showed that timolol did not dialyse readily .
If overdose occurs treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Ophthalmological - beta-blocking agents - timolol , combinations , ATC code :
S01ED 51
Mechanism of action :
GANFORT consists of two active substances : bimatoprost and timolol maleate .
These two components decrease elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) by complementary mechanisms of action and the combined effect results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound administered alone .
GANFORT has a rapid onset of action .
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent .
It is a synthetic prostamide , structurally related to prostaglandin F2α ( PGF2α ) that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors .
Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides .
The prostamide receptor , however , has not yet been structurally identified .
The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow .
Timolol is a beta1 and beta2 non-selective adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic , direct myocardial depressant , or local anaesthetic ( membrane-stabilising ) activity .
Timolol lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humour formation .
The precise mechanism of action is not clearly established , but inhibition of the increased cyclic AMP synthesis caused by endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation is probable .
Clinical effects :
The IOP-lowering effect of GANFORT is non-inferior to that achieved by adjunctive therapy of bimatoprost ( once daily ) and timolol ( twice daily ) .
There are no studies with evening dosing of GANFORT .
Morning dosing of GANFORT is therefore recommended to ensure maximal IOP-lowering effect at the time of the physiological IOP rise .
However , if necessary for patient compliance , an evening dosing may be considered .
Once-daily dosing of timolol 0.5 % has a rapid onset of maximal effect , corresponding with the time of this rise , and maintains clinically meaningful IOP-lowering over the 24-hour period .
Bimatoprost studies show comparable IOP control regardless of morning or evening dosing .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
GANFORT :
Plasma bimatoprost and timolol concentrations were determined in a crossover study comparing the monotherapy treatments to GANFORT treatment in healthy subjects .
Systemic absorption of the individual components was minimal and not affected by co-administration in a single formulation .
6 In two 12-month studies where systemic absorption was measured , no accumulation was observed with either of the individual components .
Bimatoprost :
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro .
After ocular administration , the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time .
After once daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.03 % bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks , blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection ( 0.025 ng / ml ) within 1.5 hours after dosing .
Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng / ml and 0.09 ng • hr / ml respectively , indicating that a steady drug concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 1 / kg .
In human blood , bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma .
The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 % .
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation , N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites .
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion , up to 67 % of an intravenous dose administered to healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine , 25 % of the dose was excreted via the faeces .
The elimination half-life , determined after intravenous administration , was approximately 45 minutes ; the total blood clearance was 1.5 1 / hr / kg .
Characteristics in elderly patients :
After twice daily dosing , the mean AUC 0-24hrs value of 0.0634 ng • hr / ml bimatoprost in the elderly ( subjects 65 years or older ) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng • hr / ml in young healthy adults .
However , this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing .
There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients .
Timolol :
After ocular administration of a 0.5 % eye drops solution in humans undergoing cataract surgery , peak timolol concentration was 898 ng / ml in the aqueous humour at one hour post-dose .
Part of the dose is absorbed systemically where it is extensively metabolised in the liver .
The half-life of timolol in plasma is about 4 to 6 hours .
Timolol is partially metabolised by the liver with timolol and its metabolites excreted by the kidney .
Timolol is not extensively bound to plasma .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose ocular toxicity studies on GANFORT showed no special hazard for humans .
The ocular and systemic safety profile of the individual components is well established .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential .
Studies in rodents produced species-specific abortion at systemic exposure levels 33- to 97-times that achieved in humans after ocular administration .
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥ 0.03 % daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and / or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure .
The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in 7 melanocyte number .
No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed , and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Further information
WHAT GANFORT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GANFORT is an eye drop that is used to control glaucoma .
It contains two different active substances ( bimatoprost and timolol ) that both reduce high pressure in the eye .
Bimatoprost belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides .
Timolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers .
GANFORT is prescribed to reduce high pressure in the eye .
Your eye contains a clear , watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye .
Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this .
If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough , the pressure inside the eye builds up and could eventually damage your sight .
GANFORT works by reducing the production of liquid and also increasing the amount of liquid that is drained .
This reduces the pressure inside the eye .
BEFORE YOU USE GANFORT
Do not use GANFORT :
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to bimatoprost , timolol or any of the other ingredients of
GANFORT
- if you have any breathing illnesses such as asthma or a history of asthma , or severe chronic
obstructive lung disease
- if you have heart problems such as heart weakness or heart beat disorders
Take special care with GANFORT :
Before you use this medicine , tell your doctor
- if you have now or have had in the past
• heart , blood pressure or breathing problems • overactivity of the thyroid • diabetes or low blood sugar levels ( hypoglycaemia ) • severe allergic reactions • liver or kidney problems • known risk factors for macular oedema ( swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening vision ) , for example , cataract surgery
20 GANFORT may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow , and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too .
The colour of your iris may also go darker over time .
These changes may be permanent .
The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye .
GANFORT should not be used in people under 18 unless your doctor still recommends it .
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
If you use GANFORT with another eye medicine , leave at least 5 minutes between putting in GANFORT and the other medicine .
Use any eye ointment or eye gel last .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant .
GANFORT should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor still recommends it .
GANFORT should not be used if you are breast-feeding .
Driving and using machines GANFORT may cause blurred vision in some patients .
Do not drive or use machinery until the symptoms have cleared .
Important information about some of the ingredients of GANFORT Do not use the drops while your contact lenses are in your eyes .
Wait at least 15 minutes after using the eye drops before putting your lenses back in your eyes .
A preservative in GANFORT ( benzalkonium chloride ) may cause eye irritation and is also known to discolour soft contact lenses .
HOW TO USE GANFORT
Always use GANFORT exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
The usual dose is one drop in the morning in each eye that needs treatment .

If a dose is missed , treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned .
The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye ( s ) twice daily .
When substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with AZARGA , the other agent should be discontinued and AZARGA should be started the following day .
Paediatric patients AZARGA is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
2 Use in hepatic and renal impairment No studies have been conducted with AZARGA or with timolol 5 mg / ml eye drops in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment or in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
AZARGA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis .
Since brinzolamide and its main metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney , AZARGA is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( see section 4.3 ) .
Method of administration For ocular use .
Instruct patients to shake the bottle well before use .
To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution , care must be taken not to touch the eyelids , surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle .
Instruct patients to keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances , or to any of the excipients . Bronchial asthma , a history of bronchial asthma , or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
• Sinus bradycardia , second or third degree atrioventricular block , overt cardiac failure , or cardiogenic shock . • • • • Severe allergic rhinitis and bronchial hyperreactivity ; hypersensitivity to other beta-blockers . Hyperchloraemic acidosis ( see section 4.2 ) . Severe renal impairment . Hypersensitivity to sulphonamides ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Systemic effects Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents , brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed systemically .
Due to the beta-adrenergic component , timolol , the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur .
Cardiac failure should be adequately controlled before beginning therapy with timolol .
Patients with a history of severe cardiac disease should be watched for signs of cardiac failure and have their pulse rates checked .
Respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions , including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma and , rarely , death in association with cardiac failure , have been reported following administration of timolol maleate .
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycaemia or to patients with labile insulin-dependent diabetes as beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycaemia .
They may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism and cause worsening of Prinzmetal angina , severe peripheral and central circulatory disorders and hypotension .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide , a sulphonamide .
The same types of undesirable effects that are attributable to sulphonamides may occur with topical administration .
Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur , discontinue the use of this medicinal product .
There is potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZARGA .
The concomitant administration of AZARGA and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not recommended ( see section 4.5 ) .
3 Anaphylactic reactions While taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents , patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be unresponsive to the usual doses of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions .
Concomitant therapy Timolol may interact with other medicinal products ( see section 4.5 ) .
The effect on intraocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta blockade may be potentiated when AZARGA is given to patients already receiving an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent .
The use of two local beta-adrenergic blocking agents or two local carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended .
Ocular effects There is limited experience with AZARGA in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma .
Caution should be utilised in treating these patients and close monitoring of IOP is recommended .
AZARGA has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and its use is not recommended in these patients .
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and / or physical coordination in elderly patients .
AZARGA is absorbed systemically and therefore this may occur with topical administration .
The possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients with compromised corneas ( particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count ) .
Specifically , patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when using brinzolamide is recommended , since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration and wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea .
Careful monitoring of patients with compromised corneas , such as patients with diabetes mellitus or corneal dystrophies , is recommended .
Benzalkonium chloride , which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products , has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and / or toxic ulcerative keratopathy .
Since AZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride , close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use
AZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses .
Contact with soft contact lenses is to be avoided .
Patients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the application of AZARGA and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with AZARGA .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and , although administered topically , is absorbed systemically .
Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
The potential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving AZARGA .
The cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4 ( main ) , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 .
It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole , itraconazole , clotrimazole , ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide by CYP3A4 .
Caution is advised if CYP3A 4 inhibitors are given concomitantly .
However , accumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route .
Brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isozymes .
4 There is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension and / or marked bradycardia when eye drops with timolol are administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers , guanethidine or beta-blocking agents , antiarrhythmics , digitalis glycosides or parasympathomimetics .
The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta-blockers .
Potentiated systemic beta-blockade ( e.g. decreased heart rate ) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors ( e.g. quinidine , cimetidine ) and timolol .
Beta-blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic agents .
Beta-blockers can mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of brinzolamide in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Well-controlled epidemiological studies with systemic use of beta-blockers did not indicate malformative effects , but some pharmacological effects such as bradycardia have been observed in foetuses or neonates .
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of timolol in eye drops on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn child but bradycardia and arrhythmia have been reported in one case in the foetus of a woman treated with timolol eye drops .
To date , no other relevant epidemiological data are available .
AZARGA should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Lactation It is not known whether brinzolamide is excreted in human breast milk .
Animal studies have shown excretion of brinzolamide in breast milk .
Timolol does appear in human breast milk .
However , at therapeutic doses of AZARGA , no effects on the breastfed newborns / infants are anticipated .
AZARGA can be used during breast-feeding .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
As with any eye drops , temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines .
If blurred vision occurs at instillation , the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines .
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability of elderly patients to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and / or physical coordination ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile In two clinical trials of 6 and 12 months duration involving 394 patients treated with AZARGA , the most frequently reported adverse reaction was transient blurred vision upon instillation ( 3.6 % ) , lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes .
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions The following adverse reactions are classified according to the following convention : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , or very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

Description of selected adverse reactions Dysgeusia ( bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation ) was a frequently reported systemic adverse reaction associated with the use of AZARGA during clinical trials .
It is likely to be caused by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal and is attributable to brinzolamide .
Nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the occurrence of this effect ( see section 4.2 ) .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide which is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption .
Gastrointestinal , nervous system , haematological , renal and metabolic effects are generally associated with systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
The same type of adverse reactions attributable to oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration .
AZARGA contains brinzolamide and timolol ( as timolol maleate ) .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antiglaucoma preparation and miotics ATC code :
S01ED51
Mechanism of action AZARGA contains two active substances : brinzolamide and timolol maleate .
These two components decrease elevated IOP primarily by reducing aqueous humour secretion , but do so by different mechanisms of action .
The combined effect of these two active substances results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound alone .
8 Brinzolamide is a potent inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II ( CA-II ) , the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye .
Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour secretion , presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport .
Timolol is a non-selective adrenergic-blocking agent that has no intrinsic sympathomimetic , direct myocardial depressant or membrane-stabilising activity .
Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action is related to reduced aqueous humour formation and a slight increase in outflow facility .
Pharmacodynamic effects Clinical effects :
In a twelve-month , controlled clinical trial in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who , in the investigator &apos;s opinion could benefit from a combination therapy , and who had baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg , the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice daily was 7 to 9 mmHg .
The non-inferiority of AZARGA as compared to dorzolamide 20 mg / ml + timolol 5 mg / ml in the mean IOP reduction was demonstrated across all time-points at all visits .
In a six-month , controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg , the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice daily was 7 to 9 mmHg , and was up to 3 mmHg greater than that of brinzolamide 10 mg / ml dosed twice daily and up to 2 mmHg greater than that of timolol 5 mg / ml dosed twice daily .
A statistically superior reduction in mean IOP was observed compared to both brinzolamide and timolol at all time-points and visits throughout the study .
In three controlled clinic al trials , the ocular discomfort upon instillation of AZARGA was significantly lower than that of dorzolamide 20 mg / ml + timolol 5 mg / ml .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following topical ocular administration , brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed through the cornea and into the systemic circulation .
In a pharmacokinetic study , healthy subjects received oral brinzolamide ( 1 mg ) twice daily for 2 weeks to shorten the time to reach steady-state prior to starting AZARGA administration .
Following twice daily dosing of AZARGA for 13 weeks , red blood cell ( RBC ) concentrations of brinzolamide averaged 18.8 ± 3.29 µM , 18.1 ± 2.68 µM and 18.4 ± 3.01 µM at weeks 4 , 10 and 15 , respectively , indicating that steady-state RBC concentrations of brinzolamide were maintained
At steady state , following administration of AZARGA , the mean plasma Cmax and AUC0-12h of timolol were 27 % and 28 % lower ( Cmax :
0.824 ± 0.453 ng / ml ; AUC0-12h :
4.71 ± 4.29 ng · h / ml ) , respectively , in comparison to the administration of timolol 5 mg / ml ( Cmax :
1.13 ± 0.494 ng / ml ; AUC0-12h :
6.58 ± 3.18 ng · h / ml ) .
The lower systemic exposure to timolol following AZARGA administration is not clinically relevant .
Following administration of AZARGA , mean Cmax of timolol was reached at 0.79 ± 0.45 hours .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of brinzolamide is moderate ( about 60 % ) .
Brinzolamide is sequestered in RBCs due to its high affinity binding to CA-II and to a lesser extent to CA-I .
Its active N-desethyl metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I .
The affinity of brinzolamide and metabolite to RBC and tissue CA results in low plasma concentrations .
Ocular tissue distribution data in rabbits showed that timolol can be measured in aqueous humour up to 48 hours after administration of AZARGA .
At steady-state , timolol is detected in human plasma for up to 12 hours after administration of AZARGA .
9 Metabolism The metabolic pathways for the metabolism of brinzolamide involve N-dealkylation , O-dealkylation and oxidation of its N-propyl side chain .
N-desethyl brinzolamide is a major metabolite of brinzolamide formed in humans , which also binds to CA-I in the presence of brinzolamide and accumulates in RBCs .
In vitro studies show that the metabolism of brinzolamide mainly involves CYP3A4 as well as at least four other isozymes ( CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 ) .
Timolol is metabolised by two pathways .
One route yields an ethanolamine side chain on the thiadiazole ring and the other giving an ethanolic side chain on the morpholine nitrogen and a second similar side chain with a carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen .
Timolol metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP2D6 .
Excretion Brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal excretion ( approximately 60 % ) .
About 20 % of the dose has been accounted for in urine as metabolite .
Brinzolamide and N-desethyl-brinzolamide are the predominant components found in the urine along with trace levels ( &lt; 1 % ) of the N-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites .
Timolol and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys .
Approximately 20 % of a timolol dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and the remainder excreted in urine as metabolites .
The plasma t1 / 2 of timolol is 4.8 hours after administration of AZARGA .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Brinzolamide
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with brinzolamide based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , and carcinogenic potential .
Developmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg / kg / day ( 214 times the recommended daily clinical dose of 28 µg / kg / day ) revealed no effect on foetal development despite significant maternal toxicity .
Similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of skull and sternebrae of foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg / kg / day ( 642 times the recommended daily clinical dose ) , but not 6 mg / kg / day .
These findings occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights .
Dose-related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally ranging from a slight decrease ( about 5-6 % ) at 2 mg / kg / day to nearly 14 % at 18 mg / kg / day .
During lactation , the no adverse effect level in the offspring was 5 mg / kg / day .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with timolol based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , and carcinogenic potential .
Reproduction toxicity studies with timolol showed delayed foetal ossification in rats with no adverse effects on postnatal development ( at 50 mg / kg / day or 3500 times the daily clinical dose of 14 μg / kg / day ) and increased foetal resorptions in rabbits ( at 90 mg / kg / day or 6400 times the daily clinical dose ) .

Further information
WHAT AZARGA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
AZARGA is used to treat high pressure in the eye .
This pressure can lead to an illness called glaucoma .
AZARGA is a combination of treatments for glaucoma .
It contains two active substances which work together to reduce pressure within the eye .
BEFORE YOU USE AZARGA
Do not use AZARGA − if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of AZARGA .
For a full list of ingredients please see section 6 . − if you have respiratory problems such as asthma , bronchitis or other types of breathing problems . − if you have a slow heart beat , heart failure or disorders of heart rhythm . − if you have too much acidity in your blood ( a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis ) . − if you have severe kidney problems .
Take special care with AZARGA
• if you have angina ( chest pains ) , circulation problems or low blood pressure .
AZARGA may make any of these worse .
If you are concerned about any changes in these symptoms , tell your doctor as soon as possible . • if you get any severe allergic reaction while you are using AZARGA , whatever the cause , adrenaline treatment may not be as effective .
So , when receiving any other treatment please tell the health professional that you are taking AZARGA . • if you have diabetes .
Talk to your doctor .
21
• •
if you have dry eyes or cornea problems .
Talk to your doctor .
AZARGA is not recommended for children under 18 years .
Using other medicines
AZARGA can affect or be affected by other medicines you are taking , including other eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma .
Tell your doctor if you are taking or intend to take medicines to lower blood pressure , heart medicines , medicines to treat diabetes , medicines to treat gastric ulcers , or antifungal , antiviral or antibiotic medicines .
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not use AZARGA if you are pregnant or might get pregnant .
Talk to your doctor before you use AZARGA .
If you are breast-feeding , you can use AZARGA .
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine .
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or use machines until your vision is clear .
You may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after using AZARGA .
One of the active ingredients may impair the ability of elderly patients to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and / or physical coordination .
If affected take care when driving or using machines .
Important information about some of the ingredients of AZARGA
There is a preservative in AZARGA ( benzalkonium chloride ) that can discolour soft lenses and may cause eye irritation .
Therefore , do not wear contact lenses whilst using AZARGA .
Wait 15 minutes after using AZARGA before putting your lenses back in .
HOW TO USE AZARGA
Always use AZARGA exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
The usual dose is
Adults :
One drop in the affected eye or eyes , twice a day-morning and night .
Only use AZARGA in both eyes if your doctor told you to .
Take it for as long as your doctor told you to .

22 • Get the AZARGA bottle and a mirror . • Wash your hands . • Shake well before use . • Twist off the bottle cap . • Hold the bottle , pointing down , between your thumb and fingers . • Tilt your head back .
Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger , until there is a &apos; pocket &quot; between the eyelid and your eye .
The drop will go in here ( picture 1 ) . • Bring the bottle tip close to the eye .
Use the mirror if it helps . • Do not touch your eye or eyelid , surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper .
It could infect the drops . • Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of AZARGA at a time . • Do not squeeze the bottle : it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs ( picture 2 ) . • After using AZARGA , press a finger into the corner of your eye , by the nose ( picture 3 ) .
This helps to stop AZARGA getting into the rest of the body . • If you use drops in both eyes , repeat the steps for your other eye . • Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use . • Use up one bottle before opening the next bottle .
If a drop misses your eye , try again .
If you use more AZARGA than you should , rinse your eye with warm water .
Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose .
If you forget to use AZARGA , continue with the next dose as planned .
Do not use a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose .
Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye ( s ) twice daily .
If you stop using AZARGA without speaking to your doctor , the pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight .
If you are using other eye drops , wait at least 5 minutes between using AZARGA and the other drops .
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs .
4.2 Indications for use , specifying the target species
For use in combination with standard therapy ( including diuretic support , where necessary ) for the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular regurgitation in dogs .
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in animals used for , or intended for use in breeding .
Do not use the product in dogs suffering from hypoadrenocorticism , hyperkalaemia or hyponatraemia .
Do not administer spironolactone in conjunction with NSAIDs to dogs with renal insufficiency .
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None
2 / 25 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals Kidney function and serum potassium levels should be evaluated before initiating combined treatment with spironolactone and ACE inhibitors .
Unlike in humans , an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia was not observed in clinical trials performed in dogs with this combination .
However , in dogs with renal impairment regular monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels is recommended as there may be an increased risk of hyperkalaemia .
Dogs treated concomitantly with spironolactone and NSAIDs should be correctly hydrated .
Monitoring of their renal function and plasma potassium levels is recommended before initiation and during treatment with combined therapy ( see 4.3 ) .
As spironolactone has an antiandrogenic effect , it is not recommended to administer the product to growing dogs .
As spironolactone undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation , care should be taken when using the product to treat dogs with hepatic dysfunction .
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals May cause skin sensitisation : persons known to be allergic to spironolactone should not handle the product .
Wash hands after use .
In the event of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
4.6 Adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
A reversible prostatic atrophy is often observed in entire male dogs .
4.7 Use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
Do not use during pregnancy and lactation because developmental toxicity has been observed in laboratory species .
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In clinical studies , PRILACTONE was co-administered with furosemide and pimobendan without evidence of associated adverse reactions .
Spironolactone decreases digoxin elimination and hence raises digoxin plasma concentration .
As the therapeutic index for digoxin is very narrow , it is advisable to monitor closely dogs receiving both digoxin and spironolactone .
The administration of either deoxycorticosterone or NSAIDs with spironolactone may lead to a moderate reduction of the natriuretic effects ( reduction of urinary sodium excretion ) of spironolactone .
Concomitant administration of spironolactone with ACE-inhibitors and other potassium-sparing drugs ( as angiotensin receptor blockers , ß-blockers , calcium channels blockers , etc .. ) may potentially lead to hyperkalaemia ( see 4.5 ) .
Spironolactone may cause both induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes and could therefore affect the metabolism of other drugs utilizing these metabolic pathways .
3 / 25 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use .
2 mg of spironolactone per kg of body weight once daily .
The product should be administered with food .
The tablet can either be mixed with a small amount of food offered prior to the main meal , or administered directly into the mouth after feeding .

In case of an accidental massive ingestion by a dog , there is no specific antidote or treatment .
It is therefore recommended to induce vomiting , lavage the stomach ( depending on risk assessment ) and monitor electrolytes .
Symptomatic treatment , e. g . , fluid therapy , should be provided .
4.11 Withdrawal period ( s )

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Aldosterone antagonist . ATCvet code :
QC03DA01 .
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Spironolactone and its active metabolites ( including 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone ) act as specific antagonists of aldosterone , and exert their effects by binding competitively to the mineralocorticoid receptor located in the kidneys , heart and blood vessels .
Spironolactone is a natriuretic drug ( historically described as a soft diuretic ) .
In the kidney , spironolactone inhibits the aldosterone-induced sodium retention leading to increase in sodium and subsequently water excretion , and potassium retention .
4 / 25 The renal effects of spironolactone and its metabolites lead to a decrease in extracellular volume and consequently in a decrease of cardiac preload and left atrial pressure .
The result is an improvement in heart function .
In the cardiovascular system , spironolactone prevents the detrimental effects of aldosterone .
Although the precise mechanism of action is not yet clearly defined , aldosterone promotes myocardial fibrosis , myocardial and vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction .
In experimental models in dogs , it was shown that long term therapy with an aldosterone antagonist prevents progressive left ventricle dysfunction and attenuates left ventricle remodelling in dogs with chronic heart failure .
In a clinical trial , dogs treated with spironolactone in addition to standard therapy ( ACE-inhibitors ) demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease deterioration compared to dogs treated with standard therapy alone .
When used in combination with ACE-inhibitors , spironolactone may counteract the effects of &quot; aldosterone escape . &quot;
A slight increase in aldosterone blood levels may be observed in animals on treatment .
This is thought to be due to activation of feedback mechanisms without adverse clinical consequence .
There may be a dose related hypertrophy of the adrenal zona glomerulosa at high dose rates .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone are based on its metabolites , as the parent compound is unstable at assay .
Absorption After oral administration of spironolactone to dogs , it was demonstrated that the three metabolites achieved levels of 32 to 49 % of the administered dose .
Food increases the bioavailability to 80 to 90 % .
Following oral administration of 2 to 4 mg / kg , absorption increases linearly over the range .
After multiple oral doses of 2 mg spironolactone per kg for 10 consecutive days , no accumulation is observed .
Mean Cmax of 382 µg / l and 94 µg / l are achieved for the primary metabolites , 7α -thiomethyl- spironolactone and canrenone , after 2 and 4 hours , respectively .
Steady-state conditions are reached by day 2 .
Distribution The mean volumes of distribution ( Vss ) of 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone are approximately 153 litres and 177 litres respectively .
The mean residence time of the metabolites ranges from 9 to 14 hours and they are preferentially distributed to the gastro-intestinal tract , kidney , liver and adrenal glands .
Metabolism Spironolactone is rapidly and completely metabolised by the liver into its active metabolites , 7α - thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone , which are the primary metabolites in the dog .
Elimination Spironolactone is mainly excreted via its metabolites .
Plasma clearance of canrenone is 1.45 ± 0.39 l / h / kg and 7α -thiomethyl-spironolactone is 0.89 ± 0.44 l / h / kg .
After oral administration of radiolabelled spironolactone to the dog , 70 % of the dose is recovered in faeces and 20 % in the urine .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
Manic episode :
The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
For patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
If a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
2 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
A greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
Dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( See sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6-12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
3 CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment . The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with
4 myeloproliferative disease . Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported ..
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Lactose ZYPREXA tablets contain lactose .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
5 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
6 olanzapine . Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed
across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories . Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
8 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
9 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( ≥ 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
Common :
Elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
Sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
Gastrointestinal disorders Common :
Dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
Elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
Decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained ≥ 15 % and almost a third gained ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
Induction of emesis is not recommended .
Standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 % .
10 Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5 HT2A / 2C , 5 HT3 , 5 HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α 1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence . Olanzapine also
11 showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone , olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence ( olanzapine 30.0 % , lithium 38.3 % ; p = 0.055 ) .
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser ( lithium or valproate ) , long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence , defined according to syndromic ( diagnostic ) criteria .
Paediatric population The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
The absorption is not affected by food .
Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
After oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
However , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
12 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
However , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α 1-acid-glycoprotein .
Paediatric population Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) :
The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
In clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 % higher in adolescents .
Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
Reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Estrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

Treatment with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection should be discontinued and the use of oral olanzapine should be initiated as soon as clinically appropriate .
Adults For intramuscular use .
Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is intended for short term use only , for up to a maximum of three consecutive days .
The maximum daily dose of olanzapine ( including all formulations of olanzapine ) is 20 mg .
The recommended initial dose for olanzapine injection is 10 mg , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
A lower dose ( 5 mg or 7.5 mg ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
A second injection , 5-10 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection on the basis of individual clinical status .
Not more than three injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of olanzapine of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) should not be exceeded .

For further information on continued treatment with oral olanzapine ( 5 to 20 mg daily ) , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ZYPREXA coated tablets or ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablets .
Children and adolescents There is no experience in children .
ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
86 Elderly The recommended starting dose in elderly patients ( &gt; 60 years ) is 2.5 - 5 mg .
Depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status ( see section 4.4 ) , a second injection , 2.5 - 5 mg , may be administered 2 hours after the first injection .
Not more than 3 injections should be given in any 24 hour period and the maximum daily dose of 20 mg ( including all formulations ) of olanzapine should not be exceeded .
The efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been established in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours related to conditions other than schizophrenia or manic episode .
Unstable medical conditions IM olanzapine should not be administered to patients with unstable medical conditions , such as acute myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , severe hypotension and / or bradycardia , sick sinus syndrome , or following heart surgery .
If the patient &quot; s medical history with regard to these unstable medical conditions cannot be determined , the risks and benefits of IM olanzapine should be considered in relation to other alternative treatments .
Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other medicinal products Special caution is necessary in patients who have received treatment with other medicinal products having haemodynamic properties similar to those of intramuscular olanzapine including other antipsychotics ( oral and / or intramuscular ) and benzodiazepines ( see section 4.5 ) .
Temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory depression and death has been very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) reported particularly in patients who have received benzodiazepines and / or other antipsychotics ( see section 4.8 ) .
Simultaneous injection of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.5 and 6.2 ) .
If the patient is considered to need parenteral benzodiazepine treatment , this should not be given until at least one hour after IM olanzapine administration .
If the patient has received parenteral benzodiazepine , IM olanzapine administration should only be considered after careful evaluation of clinical status and the patient should be closely monitored for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
87 Hypotension It is extremely important that patients receiving intramuscular olanzapine should be closely observed for hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation , particularly for the first 4 hours following injection and close observation should be continued after this period if clinically indicated .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be observed regularly and remedial treatment provided if required .
Patients should remain recumbent if dizzy or drowsy after injection until examination indicates that they are not experiencing hypotension including postural hypotension , bradyarrhythmia and / or hypoventilation .
The safety and efficacy of IM olanzapine has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit drugs ) ( see section 4.5 ) .
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during oral clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral administration , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
In clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection , olanzapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT or in QTc intervals .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
89 General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator oral studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in oral olanzapine clinical trials .
IM olanzapine has not been studied in patients with alcohol or drug intoxication ( see section 4.4 ) .
Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can induce hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory or central nervous system depression ( see section 4.4 ) .
Potential for interaction following intramuscular injection In a single dose intramuscular study of olanzapine 5 mg , administered 1 hour before intramuscular lorazepam 2 mg ( metabolised by glucuronidation ) , the pharmacokinetics of both medicines were unchanged .
However , the combination added to the somnolence observed with either medicines alone .
Concomitant injection of olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 6.2 ) .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
90 Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists ( see section 6.2 ) .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
A common ( 1-10 % ) undesirable effect associated with the use of intramuscular olanzapine in clinical trials was somnolence .
In post marketing reports , temporal association of treatment with IM olanzapine with cases of respiratory depression , hypotension or bradycardia and death have been very rarely reported , mostly in patients who concomitantly received benzodiazepines , and / or other antipsychotic medicinal products or who were treated in excess of olanzapine recommended daily doses ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
91 The following table is based on the undesirable effects and laboratory investigations from clinical trials with ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection rather than oral olanzapine .
Cardiac disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Bradycardia with or without hypotension or syncope , tachycardia . Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Sinus pause . Vascular Disorders Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Postural hypotension , hypotension . Respiratory disorders Uncommon ( 0.1-1 % ) :
Hypoventilation . General disorders and administration site conditions Common ( 1-10 % ) :
Injection site discomfort .
The undesirable effects listed below have been observed following administration of oral olanzapine , but may also occur following administration of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Gastrointestinal disorders
93 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
94 Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
In addition , a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with oral olanzapine in over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary
95 analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring oral olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , oral olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Oral olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers , a dose of 5 mg of ZYPREXA powder for solution for injection produced a maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) approximately 5 times higher than that seen with the same dose of olanzapine administered orally .
The Cmax occurs earlier after intramuscular compared to oral use ( 15 to 45 minutes versus 5 to 8 hours ) .
As with oral use , Cmax and area under the curve after intramuscular use are directly proportional to the dose administered .
For the same dose of olanzapine administered intramuscularly and orally , the associated area under the curve , half-life , clearance and volume of distribution are similar .
The metabolic profiles following intramuscular and oral use are similar .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) administered olanzapine intramuscularly the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
Additional pharmacokinetic data following administration of oral olanzapine are described below .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects administered oral olanzapine , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
96 In female versus male subjects administered oral olanzapine the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects administered oral olanzapine , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction administered olanzapine orally , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , laboured respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of oral studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Rapamune is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant .
It is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months .
Rapamune may be continued as maintenance therapy with corticosteroids only if ciclosporin microemulsion can be progressively discontinued ( see sections 4.2 and 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Rapamune is for oral use only .
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the guidance of an appropriately qualified specialist in transplantation .
Use in adults Initial therapy ( 2 to 3 months post-transplantation ) :
The usual dosage regimen for Rapamune is a 6 mg oral loading dose , administered as soon as possible after transplantation , followed by 2 mg once daily .
The Rapamune dose should then be individualised , to obtain whole blood trough levels of 4 to 12 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune therapy should be optimised with a tapering regimen of steroids and ciclosporin microemulsion .
Suggested ciclosporin trough concentration ranges for the first 2-3 months after transplantation are 150-400 ng / ml ( monoclonal assay or equivalent technique ) .
Maintenance Therapy :
Ciclosporin should be progressively discontinued over 4 to 8 weeks and the Rapamune dose should be adjusted to obtain whole blood trough levels of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ; see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
Rapamune should be given with corticosteroids .
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
2 Use in black recipients :
There is limited information indicating that black renal transplant recipients ( predominantly African-American ) require higher doses and trough levels of sirolimus to achieve the same efficacy as observed in non-black patients .
Currently , the efficacy and safety data are too limited to allow specific recommendations for use of sirolimus in black recipients .
Use in children and adolescents ( &lt; 18 years ) :
The available data on safety and efficacy are not sufficient to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Limited pharmacokinetic information is available in children and adolescents ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years ) :
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
Use in patients with renal impairment :
No dosage adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Use in patients with hepatic impairment :
The clearance of sirolimus may be reduced in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , it is recommended that the maintenance dose of Rapamune be reduced by approximately one half .
It is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function ( see Therapeutic drug monitoring ) .
It is not necessary to modify the Rapamune loading dose .
Therapeutic drug monitoring :
Most patients who received 2 mg of Rapamune 4 hours after ciclosporin had whole blood trough concentrations of sirolimus within the 4 to 12 ng / ml target range ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) .
Optimal therapy requires therapeutic drug concentration monitoring in all patients .
Whole blood sirolimus levels should be closely monitored in the following populations :
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting sirolimus therapy .
Careful attention should be made to clinical signs / symptoms , tissue biopsies , and laboratory parameters .
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Optimally , adjustments in Rapamune dosage should be based on more than a single trough level obtained &gt; 5 days after a previous dosing change .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
On average , the sirolimus dose will need to be 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
The rate at which the dose of sirolimus is increased should correspond to the rate of ciclosporin elimination .
If further dose adjustment ( s ) are required during maintenance therapy ( after discontinuation of ciclosporin ) , in most patients these adjustments can be based on simple proportion : new Rapamune dose = current dose x ( target concentration / current concentration ) .
A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to considerably increase sirolimus trough concentrations :
Rapamune loading dose = 3 x ( new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose ) . The
3 maximum Rapamune dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg .
If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose , the loading dose should be administered over 2 days .
Sirolimus trough concentrations should be monitored at least 3 to 4 days after a loading dose ( s ) .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , monitoring should be performed every 5 to 7 days until 3 consecutive trough levels have shown stable concentrations of sirolimus after dose adjustment or after loading dose due to the delay in reaching steady state because of the prolonged half-life .
The recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods .
Several assay methodologies have been used to measure the whole blood concentrations of sirolimus .
Currently in clinical practice , sirolimus whole blood concentration are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies .
The concentration values obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable .
When using a proprietary immunoassay system , always refer to the manufacturer &quot; s information to correlate values to a reference chromatographic assay .
All sirolimus concentrations reported in this Summary of Product Characteristics were either measured using chromatographic methods or have been converted to chromatographic method equivalents .
Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay being utilised to determine the sirolimus trough concentrations .
Other considerations for use :
Ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) and other medicinal or non-medicinal products may interact with sirolimus ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Rapamune has not been adequately studied in patients at high immunological risk ( see section 5.1 ) .
Concomitant use with other immunosuppressive agents Sirolimus has been administered concurrently with the following agents in clinical studies : ciclosporin , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , corticosteroids and cytotoxic antibodies .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
Based on information from subsequent clinical trials , the use of Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids , in combination with IL-2 receptor antibody ( IL2R Ab ) induction , is not recommended in the de novo renal transplant setting ( see section 5.1 ) .
Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination .
During treatment with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , vaccination may be less effective .
The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Rapamune .
In hepatically impaired patients , it is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be closely monitored .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , reduction in maintenance dose by one half is recommended based on decreased clearance ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Since half-life is prolonged in these patients , therapeutic drug monitoring after a loading dose or a change of dose should be performed for a prolonged period of time until stable concentrations are reached ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin or clarithromycin ) or inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin , rifabutin ) is not recommended ( see section 4.5 ) .
4 Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin , may result from immunosuppression ( see section 4.8 ) .
Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection including opportunistic infections , fatal infections , and sepsis .
Patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) .
Among these conditions are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms .
The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients , and therefore , such use is not recommended .
In two clinical studies in de novo liver transplant patients the use of sirolimus plus ciclosporin or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis , mostly leading to graft loss or death .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg / m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature .
There have also been reports of fluid accumulation , including peripheral oedema , lymphoedema , pleural effusion , and pericardial effusions ( including haemodynamically significant effusions in children and adults ) , in patients receiving Rapamune .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema , exfoliative dermatitis , and hypersensitivity vasculitis , have been associated with the administration of sirolimus ( see section 4.8 ) .
In rare cases , the concomitant administration of sirolimus and ACE inhibitors has resulted in angioneurotic oedema-type reactions .
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis .
Therefore , antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for the first 12 months following transplantation .
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation , particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease .
The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including
5 Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
In clinical trials , the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and / or fibrates was well tolerated .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Renal function should be monitored during concomitant administration of Rapamune and ciclosporin .
Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppression regimen should be considered in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels .
Caution should be exercised when co-administering other agents that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
The continued co-administration of ciclosporin and Rapamune as maintenance therapy cannot be recommended .
In patients with delayed graft function , sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported in 2 % of the patients in the study ( see section 4.8 ) .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established .
The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome / thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura / thrombotic microangiopathy ( HUS / TTP / TMA ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme in the intestinal wall and liver .
Sirolimus is also a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) located in the small intestine .
Therefore , absorption and the subsequent elimination of sirolimus may be influenced by substances that affect these proteins .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( such as ketoconazole , voriconazole , itraconazole , telithromycin , or clarithromycin ) decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus levels .
Inducers of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampin or rifabutin ) increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus levels .
Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ciclosporin ( CYP3A4 substrate ) :
The rate and extent of sirolimus absorption was significantly increased by ciclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
The effect of CsA was also reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax and tmax .
When given 2 hours before CsA administration , sirolimus Cmax and AUC were not affected .
Single-dose sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) in healthy volunteers when administered simultaneously or 4 hours apart .
It is recommended that Rapamune be administered 4 hours after ciclosporin ( microemulsion ) .
6 Rifampicin ( CYP3A4 inducer ) :
Administration of multiple doses of rifampicin decreased sirolimus whole blood concentrations following a single 10 mg dose of Rapamune oral solution .
Rifampicin increased the clearance of sirolimus by approximately 5.5-fold and decreased AUC and Cmax by approximately 82 % and 71 % , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and rifampicin is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and ketoconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Voriconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Co-administration of sirolimus ( 2 mg single dose ) with multiple-dose administration of oral voriconazole ( 400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day , then 100 mg every 12 hours for 8 days ) in healthy subjects has been reported to increase sirolimus Cmax and AUC by an average of 7-fold and 11-fold respectively .
Co-administration of sirolimus and voriconazole is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
Diltiazem ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
The simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg of Rapamune oral solution and 120 mg of diltiazem significantly affected the bioavailability of sirolimus .
Sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 1.4-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.6-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
If diltiazem is administered , sirolimus blood levels should be monitored and a dose adjustment may be necessary .
Verapamil ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of verapamil and sirolimus oral solution significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 2.3-fold , 1.1-fold , and 2.2-fold , respectively .
Plasma S- ( - ) verapamil Cmax and AUC were both increased 1.5-fold , and tmax was decreased 24 % .
Sirolimus levels should be monitored and appropriate dose reductions of both medications should be considered .
Erythromycin ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose administration of erythromycin and sirolimus oral solution significantly increased the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs .
Whole blood sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC were increased 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 4.2-fold , respectively .
The Cmax , tmax , and AUC of plasma erythromycin base were increased 1.6-fold , 1.3-fold , and 1.7-fold , respectively .
Oral contraceptives :
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
Although the results of a single dose drug interaction study with an oral contraceptive suggest the lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction , the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Other possible interactions Moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus blood levels ( e. g. calcium channel blockers : nicardipine ; antifungal agents : clotrimazole , fluconazole ; antibiotics : troleandomycin ; other substances : bromocriptine , cimetidine , danazol , protease inhibitors ) .
Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus blood levels ( e. g . St .
John &apos;s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) , anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin ) .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in
7 patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune . Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and should therefore be avoided .
Pharmacokinetic interactions may be observed with gastrointestinal prokinetic agents such as cisapride and metoclopramide .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sirolimus and any of the following substances : acyclovir , atorvastatin , digoxin , glibenclamide , methylprednisolone , nifedipine , prednisolone , and trimethoprim / sulphamethoxazole .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of sirolimus in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Rapamune should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
Effective contraception must be used during Rapamune therapy and for 12 weeks after Rapamune has been stopped .
Following administration of radiolabelled sirolimus , radioactivity is excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether sirolimus is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from sirolimus , nursing should be discontinued during therapy .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions ( occurring in 10 % of patients ) are thrombocytopenia , anaemia , pyrexia , hypertension , hypokalaemia , hypophosphataemia , urinary tract infection , hypercholesterolaemia , hyperglycaemia , hypertriglyceridaemia , abdominal pain , lymphocoele , peripheral oedema , arthralgia , acne , diarrhoea , pain , constipation , nausea , headache , increased blood creatinine , and increased blood lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) .
The incidence of any adverse event ( s ) may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented in the following table by system organ class and frequency of occurrence .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Only events for which there is at least reasonable suspicion of a causal relationship to Rapamune treatment are listed .
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .

Immunosuppression increases the susceptibility to the development of lymphoma and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.4 ) .
Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy , as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Rapamune .
10 Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
There have been rare reports of fatal hepatic necrosis with elevated trough sirolimus levels .
Cases of interstitial lung disease ( including pneumonitis and infrequently bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia ( BOOP ) and pulmonary fibrosis ) , some fatal , with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune .
In some cases , the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune .
The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus level increases .
Impaired healing following transplant surgery has been reported , including fascial dehiscence , incisional hernia , and anastomotic disruption ( e. g. wound , vascular , airway , ureteral , biliary ) .
Impairments of sperm parameters have been observed among some patients treated with Rapamune . These effects have been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases ( see section 5.3 ) .
The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS / TTP / TMA .
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has been reported .
In an ongoing study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus ( target levels of 12 - 20 ng / mL ) in maintenance renal transplant patients , enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients ( n = 90 ) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL / min ( see section 5.1 ) .
There was a higher rate of serious adverse events including pneumonia , acute rejection , graft loss and death in this sirolimus treatment arm ( n = 60 , median time post-transplant 36 months ) .
Paediatric population Controlled clinical trials with posology comparable to that currently indicated for the use of Rapamune in adults - that is , use in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months post-transplantation followed by withdrawal of ciclosporin thereafter - have not been conducted in children or adolescents ( 18 years of age ) .
Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered of high-immunologic risk , defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy ( see section 5.1 ) .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections .
The treatment regimen studied ( continuous use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitor ) is not indicated for adult or paediatric patients ( see section 4.1 ) .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
Among 89 patients known to be EBV seronegative prior to transplantation , 13 ( 15.6 % ) were reported to have developed PTLD .
All patients who developed PTLD were aged 18 years .
There is insufficient experience to recommend the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents ( see section 4.2 ) .
11 4.9 Overdose
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
One patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation after ingestion of 150 mg of Rapamune .
In general , the adverse effects of overdose are consistent with those listed in section 4.8 .
General supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of overdose .
Based on the poor aqueous solubility and high erythrocyte and plasma protein binding of Rapamune , it is anticipated that Rapamune will not be dialysable to any significant extent .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : selective immunosuppressant agents .
ATC code :
L04A A10 .
Sirolimus inhibits T cell activation induced by most stimuli , by blocking calcium dependent and calcium independent intracellular signal transduction .
Studies demonstrated that its effects are mediated by a mechanism that is different from that of ciclosporin , tacrolimus , and other immunosuppressive agents .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
The inhibition of mTOR results in blockage of several specific signal transduction pathways .
The net result is the inhibition of lymphocyte activation , which results in immunosuppression .
In animals , sirolimus has a direct effect on T and B cell activation suppressing immune mediated reactions such as allograft rejection .
Clinical Trials Patients at low to moderate immunological risk were studied in the phase 3 ciclosporin elimination-Rapamune maintenance trial , which included patients receiving a renal allograft from a cadaveric or living donor .
In addition , re-transplant recipients whose previous grafts survived for at least 6 months after transplantation were included .
Ciclosporin was not withdrawn in patients experiencing Banff Grade 3 acute rejection episodes , who were dialysis-dependent , who had a serum creatinine &gt; 400 mol / l , or who had inadequate renal function to support ciclosporin withdrawal .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
At 12 , 24 and 36 months , graft and patient survival were similar for both groups .
At 48 months , there was a statistically significant difference in graft survival in favour of the Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination group compared to the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group ( including and excluding loss to follow-up ) .
There was a significantly higher rate of first biopsy-proven rejection in the ciclosporin elimination group compared to the ciclosporin maintenance group during the period post-randomisation to 12 months ( 9.8 % vs .
4.2 % , respectively ) .
Thereafter , the difference between the two groups was not significant .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune with ciclosporin therapy group .
Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
By 60 months , the incidence of non-skin malignancies was significantly higher in the cohort who continued ciclosporin as compared with the cohort who had ciclosporin withdrawn
12 ( 8.4 % vs. 3.8 % , respectively ) .
For skin carcinoma , the median time to first occurrence was significantly delayed .
The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients ( 6-120 months after transplantation ) was assessed in a randomised , multicentre , controlled trial , stratified by calculated GFR at baseline ( 20-40 mL / min vs &gt; 40 mL / min ) .
Concomitant immunosuppressive agents included mycophenolate mofetil , azathioprine , and corticosteroids .
Enrollment in the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &lt; 40 mL / min was discontinued due to an imbalance in safety events ( see section 4.8 ) .
In the patient stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , renal function was not improved overall .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar at 1 and 2 years .
Treatment emergent adverse events occurred more frequently during the first 6 months after Rapamune conversion .
In the stratum with baseline calculated GFR &gt; 40 mL / min , the mean and median urinary protein to creatinine ratios were significantly higher in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to those of the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group at 24 months ( see section 4.4 ) .
New onset nephrosis ( nephrotic syndrome ) was also reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
At 2 years , the rate of non-melanoma skin malignancies was significantly lower in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group ( 1.8 % and 6.9 % ) .
In a subset of the study patients with a baseline GFR &gt; 40 mL / min and normal urinary protein excretion , calculated GFR was higher at 1 and 2 years in patients converted to Rapamune than for the corresponding subset of calcineurin inhibitor continuation patients .
The rates of acute rejection , graft loss , and death were similar , but urinary protein excretion was increased in the Rapamune treatment arm of this subset .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal function was not better in the treatment arms with de novo Rapamune without a calcineurin inhibitor .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Rapamune was assessed in a 36-month controlled clinical trial enrolling renal transplant patients 18 years of age considered at high-immunologic risk , defined as having a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and / or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
The Rapamune group failed to demonstrate superiority to the control group in terms of the first occurrence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection , graft loss , or death .
One death occurred in each group .
The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function , serum lipid abnormalities ( including but not limited to increased serum triglycerides and total cholesterol ) , and urinary tract infections ( see section 4.8 ) .
An unacceptably high frequency of PTLD was seen in a paediatric clinical transplant study when full dose Rapamune was administered to children and adolescents in addition to full dose calcineurin inhibitors with basiliximab and corticosteroids ( see section 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
The systemic availability of sirolimus in combination with simultaneously administered ciclosporin ( Sandimune ) is approximately 14 % . Upon repeated
13 administration , the average blood concentration of sirolimus is increased approximately 3-fold .
The terminal half-life in stable renal transplant patients after multiple oral doses was 62 16h .
The effective half-life , however , is shorter and mean steady-state concentrations were achieved after 5 to 7 days .
The blood to plasma ratio ( B / P ) of 36 indicates that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for sirolimus obtained from 19 renal transplant patients receiving microemulsion ciclosporin ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune ) and corticosteroids , following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune solution in a phase III clinical trial , were ; Cmax , ss 12.2 6.2 ng / ml , tmax , ss 3.01 2.40h , AUC , ss 158 70 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 182 72 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
There was no significant difference in any of these parameters over time up to 6 months after transplantation .
Mean sirolimus whole blood trough levels from the same phase III trial were 7.2 ng / ml ( 4.0 to 11 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 226 ) for the 2 mg per day dose and 14 ng / ml ( 8.0 to 22 ng / ml , expressed as chromatographic assay values ; n = 219 ) for the 5 mg per day dose ( see section 4.2 ) .
Sirolimus is a substrate for both cytochrome P450 IIIA4 ( CYP3A4 ) and P-glycoprotein .
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by O-demethylation and / or hydroxylation .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
Sirolimus is the major component in human whole blood and contributes to greater than 90 % of the immunosuppressive activity .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Clinical studies of Rapamune did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
In healthy volunteers , a high fat meal altered the bioavailability characteristics of oral liquid sirolimus .
There was a 34 % decrease in the peak blood sirolimus concentration ( Cmax ) , a 3.5-fold increase in the time to peak concentration ( tmax ) , and a 35 % increase in total exposure ( AUC ) .
It is recommended that Rapamune be taken consistently either with or without food .
The use of orange juice and water to dilute Rapamune were equivalent with respect to Cmax , and AUC .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and must therefore be avoided .
In paediatric patients on dialysis ( 30 % to 50 % reduction in glomerular filtration rate ) within age ranges of 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years , the mean weight-normalised CL / F was larger for younger paediatric patients ( 580 ml / h / kg ) than for older paediatric patients ( 450 ml / h / kg ) as compared with adults ( 287 ml / h / kg ) .
There was a large variability for individuals within the age groups .
Sirolimus concentrations were measured in concentration-controlled trials of paediatric renal-transplant patients who were also receiving ciclosporin and corticosteroids .
The target for trough concentrations was 10-20 ng / mL .
At steady state , 8 children aged 6-11 years received mean SD doses of 1.75 0.71 mg / day ( 0.064 0.018 mg / kg , 1.65 0.43 mg / m2 ) while 14 adolescents aged 12-18 years received mean SD doses of 2.79 1.25 mg / day ( 0.053 0.0150 mg / kg , 1.86 0.61 mg / m2 ) .
The younger children had a higher weight-normalized Cl / F ( 214 mL / h / kg ) compared with the adolescents ( 136 mL / h / kg ) .
These data indicate that younger children might require higher bodyweight-adjusted doses than adolescents and adults to achieve similar target concentrations .
However , the development of such special dosing recommendations for children requires more data to be definitely confirmed .
In mild and moderate hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification A or B ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 61 % and 43 % , respectively , and CL / F was decreased 33 % compared to normal healthy subjects .
In severe hepatically impaired patients ( Child-Pugh classification C ) , mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1 / 2 were increased 210 % and 170 % respectively , and CL / F was
14 decreased by 67 % compared to normal healthy subjects . The longer half-lives observed in hepatically impaired patients delay reaching steady state .
The pharmacokinetics of sirolimus were similar in various populations with renal function ranging from normal to absent ( dialysis patients ) .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies , but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows : pancreatic islet cell vacuolation , testicular tubular degeneration , gastrointestinal ulceration , bone fractures and calluses , hepatic haematopoiesis , and pulmonary phospholipidosis .
Sirolimus was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays , the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay , the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Carcinogenicity studies conducted in mouse and rat showed increased incidences of lymphomas ( male and female mouse ) , hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma ( male mouse ) and granulocytic leukaemia ( female mouse ) .
It is known that malignancies ( lymphoma ) secondary to the chronic use of immunosuppressive agents can occur and have been reported in patients in rare instances .
In mouse , chronic ulcerative skin lesions were increased .
The changes may be related to chronic immunosuppression .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
Partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were reported in a 13-week rat study .
Reductions in testicular weights and / or histological lesions ( e. g. tubular atrophy and tubular giant cells ) were observed in rats and in a monkey study .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) .

Rapamune 1 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 1 mg sirolimus .
Coated tablet .
White coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 1 mg &quot; on one side .
Bioavailability has not been determined for tablets after they have been crushed , chewed or split and therefore this cannot be recommended .
Maintenance therapy :
In patients for whom ciclosporin withdrawal is either unsuccessful or cannot be attempted , the combination of ciclosporin and Rapamune should not be maintained for more than 3 months post-transplantation .
In such patients , when clinically appropriate , Rapamune should be discontinued and an alternative immunosuppressive regimen instituted .
Clinical studies with Rapamune oral solution did not include a sufficient number of patients &gt; 65 years of age to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients .
Rapamune tablets administered to 12 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age also gave similar results to adult patients ( n = 167 ) 18 to 65 years of age .
( 1 ) in patients with hepatic impairment ; ( 2 ) when inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are concurrently administered and after their discontinuation ( see section 4.5 ) ; and / or ( 3 ) if ciclosporin dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued , as these populations are most likely to have special dosing requirements .
To minimize variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients can be switched from the solution to the tablet formulation on a mg per mg basis .
It is recommended that a trough concentration be taken 1 or 2 weeks after switching formulations or tablet strength to confirm that the trough concentration is within the recommended target range .
Following the discontinuation of ciclosporin therapy , a target trough range of 12 to 20 ng / ml ( chromatographic assay ) is recommended .
Ciclosporin inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus , and
19 consequently , sirolimus levels will decrease when ciclosporin is discontinued unless the sirolimus dose is increased .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has not been extensively investigated .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence , most fatal , have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen .
Patients administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia using laboratory tests and if hyperlipidemia is detected , subsequent interventions such as diet , exercise , and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated .
The risk / benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune .
Similarly the risk / benefit of continued Rapamune therapy should be re-evaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia .
During Rapamune therapy , patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and / or fibrate , should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects as described in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of these agents .
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended .
In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients , increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed at 6 to 24 months after conversion to Rapamune ( see section 5.1 ) .
Sirolimus tablets contain sucrose and lactose .
In those patients with a history of sucrase insufficiency , isomaltase insufficiency , fructose intolerance , glucose malabsorption , galactose malabsorption , galactose intolerance ( e. g . , galactosemia ) , or Lapp lactase deficiency , a careful risk / benefit assessment should be performed prior to prescribing sirolimus tablets .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure from Rapamune oral solution as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax , tmax , and AUC of 4.4-fold , 1.4-fold , and 10.9-fold , respectively .
Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either diltiazem or its metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem .
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between Rapamune oral solution and 0.3 mg norgestrel / 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol .
23 the results cannot exclude the possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long term treatment with Rapamune .
Although sirolimus inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 in vitro , the active substance is not expected to inhibit the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses of Rapamune .
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Sepsis Pneumonia Pyelonephritis Herpes simplex Fungal , viral , and bacterial infections ( such as mycobacterial infections , including tuberculosis , Epstein-Barr virus , CMV , and Herpes zoster )
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hypophosphataemia Hypercholesterolaemia Hyperglycaemia Hypertriglyceridaemia
Vascular disorders Respiratory , thoracic , and mediastinal disorders
Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary haemorrhage
Hepatoxicity has been reported .
The risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
At present , there is minimal experience with overdose .
Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a critical kinase for cell cycle progression .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months was significantly higher for patients receiving Rapamune following ciclosporin elimination than for those in the Rapamune
28 with ciclosporin therapy group . Based upon the analysis of data from 36 months and beyond , which showed a growing difference in graft survival and renal function , as well as significantly lower blood pressure in the ciclosporin elimination group , it was decided to discontinue subjects from the Rapamune with ciclosporin group .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
An abbreviated dosing schedule of daclizumab was used in one of the studies .
Subjects were to receive Rapamune ( sirolimus target concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to receive calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression without Rapamune .
Much of the general pharmacokinetic information was obtained using the oral solution , which is summarised first .
Information directly related to the tablet formulation is summarised specifically in the Oral Tablet section .
Oral solution Following administration of the oral solution , sirolimus is rapidly absorbed , with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour in healthy subjects receiving single doses and 2 hours in patients with stable renal allografts receiving multiple doses .
Seven major metabolites , including hydroxyl , demethyl , and hydroxydemethyl , are identifiable in whole blood .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the adult population ( n = 822 ) from 18 to 65 years of age .
30 Oral Tablet In healthy subjects , the mean extent of bioavailability of sirolimus after single-dose administration of the tablet formulation is about 27 % higher relative to the oral solution .
The mean Cmax was decreased by 35 % and mean tmax increased by 82 % .
The difference in bioavailability was less marked upon steady-state administration to renal transplant recipients , and therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated in randomised study of 477 patients .
When switching patients between oral solution and tablet formulations , it is recommended to give the same dose and to verify the sirolimus trough concentration 1 to 2 weeks later to assure that it remains within recommended target ranges .
Also when switching between different tablet strengths , verification of trough concentrations is recommended .
In 24 healthy volunteers receiving Rapamune tablets with a high-fat meal , Cmax , tmax and AUC showed increases of 65 % , 32 % , and 23 % , respectively .
To minimise variability , Rapamune tablets should be taken consistently with or without food .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and must , therefore , be avoided .
Sirolimus concentrations , following the administration of Rapamune tablets ( 5 mg ) to healthy subjects as single doses are dose proportional between 5 and 40 mg .
In most patients receiving Rapamune tablets with a loading dose of 6 mg followed by an initial maintenance dose of 2 mg , whole blood sirolimus trough concentrations rapidly achieved steady-state concentrations within the recommended target range ( 4 to 12 ng / ml , chromatographic assay ) .
Sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters following daily doses of 2 mg Rapamune tablets administered in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion ( 4 hours prior to Rapamune tablets ) and corticosteroids in 13 renal transplant patients , based on data collected at months 1 and 3 after transplantation , were :
Cmin , ss , 7.39 2.18 ng / ml ; Cmax , ss , 15.0 4.9 ng / ml ; tmax , ss , 3.46 2.40 h ; AUC , ss , 230 67 ng h / ml ; CL / F / WT , 139 63 ml / h / kg ( parameters calculated from LC-MS / MS assay results ) .
The corresponding results for the oral solution in the same clinical trial were Cmin , ss 5.40 2.50 ng / ml , Cmax , ss 14.4 5.3 ng / ml , tmax , ss 2.12 0.84 h , AUC , ss 194 78 ng h / ml , CL / F / W 173 50 ml / h / kg .
Whole blood trough sirolimus concentrations , as measured by LC / MS / MS , were significantly correlated ( r2 = 0.85 ) with AUC , ss .
Based on monitoring in all patients during the period of concomitant therapy with ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 8.6 3.0 ng / ml ( 5.0 to 13 ng / ml ) and 2.1 0.70 mg ( 1.5 to 2.7 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
From month 3 to month 12 , following discontinuation of ciclosporin , mean ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) troughs ( expressed as chromatographic assay values ) and daily doses were 19 4.1 ng / ml ( 14 to 24 ng / mL ) and 8.2 4.2 mg ( 3.6 to 13.6 mg ) , respectively ( see section 4.2 ) .
Therefore , the sirolimus dose was approximately 4-fold higher to account for both the absence of the pharmacokinetic interaction with ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) and the augmented immunosuppressive requirement in the absence of ciclosporin ( 2-fold increase ) .
In rat , testicular interstitial cell adenomas were likely indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .
In rats , sirolimus caused embryo / foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights ( with associated delays in skeletal ossification ) . ( see section 4.6 ) .

Rapamune 2 mg coated tablets .
Each tablet contains 2 mg sirolimus .
Yellow to beige coloured , triangular-shaped coated tablet marked &quot; RAPAMUNE 2 mg &quot; on one side .
Maintenance therapy :
To minimise variability , Rapamune should be taken at the same time in relation to ciclosporin , 4 hours after the ciclosporin dose , and consistently either with or without food ( see section 5.2 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune , including lymphocele and wound dehiscence .
Patients who were successfully withdrawn from ciclosporin had lower serum creatinine levels and higher calculated glomerular filtration rates , as well as lower incidence of malignancy , compared to patients remaining on ciclosporin .
Sirolimus administered concomitantly ( 5 mg ) , and at 2h ( 5 mg ) and 4h ( 10 mg ) after CsA ( 300 mg ) resulted in increased sirolimus AUC by approximately 183 % , 141 % and 80 % respectively .
Ketoconazole ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) :
Inhibitors of P-gp may decrease the efflux of sirolimus from intestinal cells and increase sirolimus levels .
Most patients were on immunosuppressive regimens which included Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Rare ( 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 )
Hepatotoxicity has been reported , the risk may increase as the trough sirolimus level increases .
In another study enrolling renal transplant patients 20 years of age that was intended to assess the safety of progressive corticosteroid withdrawal ( beginning at six months post-transplantation ) from an immunosuppressive regimen initiated at transplantation that included full-dose immunosuppression with both Rapamune and a calcineurin inhibitor in combination with basiliximab induction , of the 274 patients enrolled , 19 ( 6.9 % ) were reported to have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) .
Patients at high immunological risk of graft loss were not studied in sufficient number in the ciclosporin elimination- Rapamune maintenance trials and are not recommended for this treatment regimen .
In two multi-centre clinical studies , de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor , MMF , corticosteroids , and an IL-2 receptor antagonist ( see section 4.4 ) .
After a single dose of &#91; 14C &#93; sirolimus in healthy volunteers , the majority ( 91.1 % ) of radioactivity was recovered from the faeces , and only a minor amount ( 2.2 % ) was excreted in urine .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and must , therefore , be avoided .
In reproduction toxicity studies decreased fertility in male rats was observed .

Further information
WHAT RAPAMUNE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Rapamune belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants .
It helps to control your body &quot; s immune system after you have received an organ transplant .
It is used to prevent your body from rejecting transplanted kidneys and is normally used with medicines called corticosteroids and initially with ciclosporin .
BEFORE YOU TAKE RAPAMUNE
Do not take Rapamune if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to sirolimus or any of the other ingredients of Rapamune .
Take special care with Rapamune if you have any liver problems or have had a disease which may have affected your liver , please tell your doctor as this may affect the dose of Rapamune that you receive. immunosuppressive medicines may decrease your body &quot; s ability to fight infection , and may increase the risk of developing cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin .
Your doctor will perform tests to monitor the levels of Rapamune in your blood .
Your doctor will also perform tests to monitor your kidney function and , possibly , your liver function , during therapy with Rapamune .
Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor because of the increased risk for skin cancer .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , or have recently taken any other medicines , including those obtained without a prescription .
Some medicines can interfere with the action of
67 Rapamune .
In particular , you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following : any other immunosuppressive agents excluding ciclosporin or corticosteroids. antibiotics or antifungal medicines used to treat infection e. g. rifampicin , clarithromycin , erythromycin , telithromycin , troleandomycin , rifabutin , clotrimazole , fluconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole and voriconazole. high blood pressure medicines or medicines for heart problems including nicardipine , verapamil and diltiazem. anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin. medicines used to treat-ulcers or other gastrointestinal disorders such as cisapride , cimetidine , metoclopramide. bromocriptine ( used in the treatment of Parkinsons &quot; disease and various hormonal disorders ) , danazol ( used in the treatment of gynaecological disorders ) , or protease inhibitors ( used in the treatment of HIV ) . St. John &quot; s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) .
The use of Rapamune may lead to increased blood concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment .
Medicines known as &quot; statins &quot; and &quot; fibrates &quot; used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of muscle breakdown ( rhabdomyolysis ) .
Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs to lower your blood fats .
Taking Rapamune with food and drink Rapamune should be taken consistently , either with or without food .
Rapamune should be diluted only with water or orange juice .
Do not take Rapamune with grapefruit juice .
Pregnancy and breast feeding You must use effective contraception methods during treatment with Rapamune and for 12 weeks after treatment has stopped .
If you are unsure , or think you may have become pregnant , talk to your doctor .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
Decreased sperm count has been associated with the use of Rapamune and usually resolves after discontinuation .
It is not known whether Rapamune passes into breast milk .
Patients taking Rapamune should discontinue breast-feeding .
Use in children and adolescents There is limited experience with the administration of Rapamune in children and adolescents .
Driving and using machines No specific studies on the effects of Rapamune on the ability to drive and use machines have been conducted .
Although Rapamune treatment is not expected to affect your ability to drive , if you have any concerns please consult your doctor .
Important information about one of the ingredients of Rapamune WARNING :
This medicine contains 1.5 % to 2.5 % ethanol .
Each 2 mg dose contains up to 50 mg of alcohol .
Alcohol may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism , epilepsy , brain injury or disease as well as for pregnant women and children .

HOW TO TAKE RAPAMUNE
Rapamune is for oral use only .

Usually for an adult your doctor will give you an initial dose of 6 mg at the time of the kidney transplant operation .
Then you will need to take 2 mg of Rapamune each day , unless otherwise directed by your doctor .
Your dose will be adjusted depending on the level of Rapamune in your blood .
Your doctor will need to perform a blood test to measure Rapamune concentrations .

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines , Rapamune can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
However , since Rapamune is taken in combination with other medicines , the side effects cannot always be attributed with absolute certainty to Rapamune .
When taken with medicines called calcineurin inhibitors ( ciclosporin or tacrolimus ) , Rapamune may increase the risk of kidney damage with low blood platelets and low red blood cell counts with or without rash ( thrombocytopenic purpura / haemolytic uraemic syndrome ) .
Immunosuppressants , including Rapamune , reduce your body &quot; s own defence mechanisms to stop you rejecting your transplanted organ .
Consequently your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections .
So if you are taking Rapamune you may therefore catch more infections than usual such as infections of the skin , mouth , stomach and intestines , lungs and urinary tract .
70 Possible side effects of Rapamune are listed according to the following categories :
Very common : more than 1 per 10 Common : less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 Uncommon : less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 Rare : less than 1 per 1000

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
Manic episode :
The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
For patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
If a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-20 mg / day .
An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after
2 appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
ZYPREXA VELOTAB Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva , so it can be easily swallowed .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
A greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
Dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
In cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , ZYPREXA coated tablets should be used .
( See sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
3 Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident .
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6- 12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
4 Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , alanine transferase ( ALT ) , aspartate transferase ( AST ) have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease .
Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
5 Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Phenylalanine ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains aspartame , which is a source of phenylalanine .
May be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Mannitol ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains mannitol .
Sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate Olanzapine orodispersible tablet contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate . These preservatives are known to cause urticaria .
Generally , delayed type reactions such as contact dermatitis may occur , but rarely immediate reactions with bronchospasm may occur .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
6 Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults The most frequently ( seen in 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects ,
7 transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
Weight gain 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
9 7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short- term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Very common ( 10 % ) , common ( 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
10 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

9 Weight gain 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained 15 % and almost a third gained 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
Induction of emesis is not recommended .
Standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 % .
Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5HT2A / 2C , 5HT3 , 5HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α 1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
In addition , a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients , while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients .
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms , olanzapine was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms .
In a multinational , double-blind , comparative study of schizophrenia , schizoaffective , and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms ( baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) favouring olanzapine ( -6.0 ) versus haloperidol ( -3.1 ) .
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
In a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence .
Olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone , olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence ( olanzapine 30.0 % , lithium 38.3 % ; p = 0.055 ) .
12 In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser ( lithium or valproate ) , long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence , defined according to syndromic ( diagnostic ) criteria .
Paediatric population The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
The absorption is not affected by food .
Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
Cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
After oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
However , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
However , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or
13 smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
In a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α 1-acid-glycoprotein .
Paediatric population Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) :
The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
In clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 % higher in adolescents .
Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity :
Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; area under the curve &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
Reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Estrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

ZYPREXA VELOTAB 10 mg orodispersible tablets
Each orodispersible tablet contains 10 mg olanzapine .
Each orodispersible tablet contains 0.80 mg aspartame , 0.15 mg sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate , 0.05 mg sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate . For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
16 appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
4.3 Contraindications
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
QT interval In clinical trials , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Very common
22 Hepato-biliary disorders
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( 10 % ) , common ( 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; area under the curve &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .

36 Hepato-biliary disorders
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( 10 % ) , common ( 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hr ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hr ) was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non-smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hr and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
41 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
Such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; area under the curve &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose ) .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Myfenax is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal , cardiac or hepatic transplants .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Myfenax should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists .
Use in renal transplant :
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation .
The recommended dose in renal transplant patients is 1.0 g administered twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
Children and adolescents : the recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg / m2 administered orally twice daily ( up to a maximum of 2 g daily ) .
Myfenax capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area of at least 1.25 m2 .
Patients with a body surface are of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Myfenax capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily ( 1.5 g daily dose ) .
Patients with a body surface area greater than 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Myfenax capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group ( see section 4.8 ) compared with adults , temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required ; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction .
Children ( &lt; 2 years ) : there are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years .
These are insufficient to make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended .
Use in cardiac transplant :
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation .
The recommended dose in cardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily ( 3 g daily dose ) .
2 Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Use in hepatic transplant :
Adults : intravenous mycophenolate should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant , with oral Myfenax initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated .
The recommended oral dose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily ( 3 g daily dose ) .
Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Use in elderly ( ≥ 65 years )
The recommended dose of 1.0 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a day for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly .
Use in renal impairment
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 25 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ) , outside the immediate post-transplant period , doses greater than 1 g administered twice a day should be avoided .
These patients should also be carefully observed .
No dose adjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively ( see section 5.2 ) .
No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment .
Use in severe hepatic impairment
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease .
No data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease .
Treatment during rejection episodes
Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil .
Renal transplant rejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics ; dosage reduction or interruption of Myfenax is not required .
There is no basis for Myfenax dose adjustment following cardiac transplant rejection .
No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance , to mycophenolic acid or any of the excipients ..
Myfenax is contraindicated in women who are breast-feeding ( see section 4.6 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including Myfenax , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.8 ) .
The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent .
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and ultra violet ( UV ) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Patients receiving Myfenax should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection , unexpected bruising , bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression .
3 Patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Myfenax , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) , fatal infections and sepsis ( see section 4.8 ) .
Among the opportunistic infections are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms .
Patients receiving Myfenax should be monitored for neutropenia , which may be related to Myfenax itself , concomitant medicinal products , viral infections , or some combination of these causes .
Patients taking Myfenax should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month , twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment then monthly through the first year .
If neutropenia develops ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.3 x 103 / μ l ) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue Myfenax .
Patients should be advised that during treatment with Myfenax , vaccinations may be less effective and the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
Influenza vaccination may be of value .
Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination .
Because mycophenolate has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events , including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration , haemorrhage and perforation , Myfenax should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease .
Myfenax is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) inhibitor .
On theoretical grounds , therefore , it should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HGPRT ) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome .
It is recommended that Myfenax should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such concomitant administration has not been studied .
In view of the significant reduction in the AUC ( area under the curve ) of MPA by cholestyramine , caution should be used in the concomitant administration of Myfenax with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfenax .
The risk-benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with tacrolimus or sirolimus has not been established ( see also section 4.5 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Aciclovir : higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone .
The changes in MPAG ( the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ) pharmacokinetics ( MPAG increased by 8 % ) were minimal and are not considered clinically significant .
Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment , as are aciclovir concentrations , the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir , or its prodrugs , e. g. valaciclovir , to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations of both substances may occur .
Antacids with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides : absorption of mycophenolate mofetil was decreased when administered with antacids .
Cholestyramine : following single dose administration 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-treated with 4 g three times a day ( TID ) of cholestyramine for 4 days , there was a 40 % reduction in the AUC of MPA ( see section 4.4 and section 5.2 ) .
Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the potential to reduce efficacy of Myfenax .
4 Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic circulation : caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic circulation because of their potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfenax .
Ciclosporin A : ciclosporin A ( CsA ) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil .
In contrast , if concomitant ciclosporin treatment is stopped , an increase in MPA AUC of around 30 % should be expected .
Ganciclovir ; based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate ( see section 4.2 ) and ganciclovir , it is anticipated that co- administration of these agents ( which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion ) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration .
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and mycophenolate mofetil dose adjustment is not required .
In patients with renal impairment in which Myfenax and ganciclovir or its prodrugs , e. g. valganciclovir , are co-administered the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients monitored carefully .
Oral contraceptives : the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-administration of mycophenolate ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Rifampicin : in patients not also taking ciclosporin , concomitant administration of Mycophenolate mofetil and rifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure ( AUC0-12h ) of 18 % to 70 % .
It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myfenax doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is administered concomitantly .
Sirolimus : in renal transplant patients , concomitant administration of mycphenolate mofetil and CsA resulted in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50 % compared with patients receiving the combination of sirolimus and similar doses of Myfenax ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Sevelamer : decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC by 30 % and 25 % , respectively , were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences ( i. e. graft rejection ) .
It is recommended , however , to administer Myfenax at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA .
There is no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole : no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed .
Norfloxacin and metronidazole : in healthy volunteers , no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin and metronidazole separately .
However , norfloxacin and metronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30 % following a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil .
Tacrolimus : in liver transplant recipients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus , the AUC and Cmax of MPA , the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil , were not significantly affected by trough tacrolimus level .
In renal transplant patients , the tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil .
However , in hepatic transplant patients , there was an increase of approximately 20 % in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil ( 1.5 g taken twice &#91; BID &#93; a day , morning and evening &#93; ) were administered to patients taking tacrolimus ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Other interactions : co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG by 3-fold .
Thus , other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion .
5 Live vaccines : live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished ( see also section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
It is recommended that Myfenax therapy should not be initiated until a negative pregnancy test has been obtained .
Effective contraception must be used before beginning Myfenax therapy , during therapy , and for six weeks following discontinuation of therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
Patients should be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur .
The use of Myfenax is not recommended during pregnancy and should be reserved for cases where no more suitable alternative treatment is available .
Myfenax should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
There is limited data from the use of mycophenolate mofetil in pregnant women .
However , congenital malformations including ear malformations , i. e. abnormally formed or absent external / middle ear have been reported in children of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy .
Cases of spontaneous abortions have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether this substance is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants , Myfenax is contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
The pharmacodynamics profile and the reported adverse reactions indicate that an effect is unlikely .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects cover adverse reactions from clinical trials :
The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids include diarrhoea , leucopenia , sepsis and vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
Malignancies :
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including mycophenolate , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.4 ) .
Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.6 % of patients receiving mycophenolate ( 2 g or 3 g daily ) in combination with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year .
Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 3.6 % of patients ; other types of malignancy occurred in 1.1 % of patients .
Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data .
Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year , but less than 3 years .
Opportunistic infections :
All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections ; the risk increased with total immunosuppressive load ( see section 4.4 ) .
The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate ( 2 g or 3 g daily ) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) viraemia / syndrome and Herpes simplex .
The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia / syndrome was 13.5 % .
6 Children and adolescents :
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study , which recruited 92 paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years who where given 600 mg / m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily , were generally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate twice daily .
However , the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population , particularly in children under 6 years of age , when compared to adults : diarrhoea , sepsis , leucopenia , anaemia and infection .
Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) :
Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to immunosuppression .
Elderly patients receiving Myfenax as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen , may be at increased risk of certain infections ( including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease ) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema , compared to younger individuals .
Other adverse reactions :
Adverse reactions , probably or possibly related to mycophenolate , reported in ≥ 1 / 10 and in ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 of patients treated with mycophenolate in the controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are listed in the following table .
Within the system organ classes , undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency , using the following categories : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) . Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

Note :
501 ( 2 g mycophenolate daily ) , 289 ( 3 g mycophenolate daily ) and 277 ( 2 g intravenous / 3 g oral mycophenolate daily ) patients were treated in Phase III studies for the prevention of rejection in renal , cardiac and hepatic transplantation , respectively .
The following undesirable effects cover adverse reactions from post-marketing experience : the types of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing with mycophenolate are similar to those seen in the controlled renal , cardiac and hepatic transplant studies .
Additional adverse reactions reported during post-marketing are described below with the frequencies reported within brackets if known .
Gastrointestinal : colitis including cytomegalovirus colitis , ( common ) , pancreatitis , ( common ) and intestinal villous atrophy .
Disorders related to immunosuppression : serious life-threatening infections including meningitis , endocarditis , tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection .
Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy , as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy ( PML ) , have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants , including Myfenax .
Agranulocytosis ( uncommon ) and neutropenia have been reported ; therefore regular monitoring of
9 patients taking Myfenax is advised ( see section 4.4 ) .
Hypersensitivity : hypersensitivity reactions , including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported .
Congenital disorders : see further details in section 4.6 . 4.9 Overdose Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-marketing experience . In many of these cases , no adverse events were reported .
In those overdose cases in which adverse events were reported , the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal product .
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression ( see section 4.4 ) .
If neutropenia develops , dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced ( see section 4.4 ) .
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG .
Bile acid sequestrants , such as cholestyramine , can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic re- circulation of the drug ( see section 5.2 ) .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : immunosuppressive agents ATC code :
LO4A A06
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) .
MPA is a potent , selective , uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase , and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA .
Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways , MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following oral administration , mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite , MPA .
As evidenced by suppression of acute rejection following renal transplantation , the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate is correlated with MPA concentration .
The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil , based on MPA AUC , is 94 % relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil .
Food had no effect on the extent of absorption ( MPA AUC ) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients .
However , MPA Cmax was decreased by 40 % in the presence of food .
Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration .
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations , is 97 % bound to plasma albumin .
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation , secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually observed at approximately 6 - 12 hours post-dose .
A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40 % is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine ( 4 g TID ) , indicating that there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation .
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ( MPAG ) , which is not pharmacologically active .
10 A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA ( &lt; 1 % of dose ) in the urine .
Orally administered radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose ; with 93 % of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the faeces .
Most ( about 87 % ) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG .
At clinically encountered concentrations , MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis .
However , at high MPAG plasma concentrations ( &gt; 100μ g / ml ) , small amounts of MPAG are removed .
In the early post-transplant period ( &lt; 40 days post-transplant ) , renal , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30 % lower and Cmax approximately 40 % lower compared to the late post-transplant period ( 3 - 6 months post-transplant ) .
Renal impairment :
In a single dose study ( 6 subjects / group ) , mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe chronic renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 25 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ) were 28-75 % higher relative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment .
However , the mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects , consistent with the known renal elimination of MPAG .
Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal impairment has not been studied .
No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment .
Delayed renal graft function :
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant , mean MPA AUC ( 0-12h ) was comparable to that seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function .
Mean plasma MPAG AUC ( 0- 12h ) was 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function .
There may be a transient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft function .
Dose adjustment of Myfenax does not appear to be necessary .
Hepatic impairment :
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis , hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease .
Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend on the particular disease .
However , hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage , such as primary biliary cirrhosis , may show a different effect .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients given 600 mg / m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily .
This dose achieved MPA AUC values similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate at a dose of 1 g BID in the early and late post-transplant period .
MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early and late post- transplant period .
Pharmacokinetic behaviour of mycophenolate in the elderly has not been formally evaluated .
Oral contraceptives :
The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co administration of mycophenolate ( see also section 4.5 ) .
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate ( 1 g BID ) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol ( 0.02 mg to 0.04 mg ) and levonorgestrel ( 0.05 mg to 0.15 mg ) , desogestrel ( 0.15 mg ) or gestodene ( 0.05 mg to 0.10 mg ) conducted in 18 non-transplant women ( not taking other immunosuppressants ) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives .
Serum levels of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and progesterone were not significantly affected .
11 5.3 Preclinical safety data
In experimental models , mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic .
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day and 1.3-2 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day .
Two genotoxicity assays ( in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test ) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations .
These effects can be related to the pharmacodynamics mode of action , i. e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells .
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity .
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg kg-1 day-1 .
The systemic exposure at this dose represents 2-3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day in renal transplant patients and 1.3-2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day in cardiac transplant patients .
In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats , oral doses of 4.5 mg kg-1 day-1 caused malformations ( including anophthalmia , agnathia and hydrocephaly ) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .
No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation .
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits , foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 6 mg kg-1 day-1 ( including anophthalmia , agnathia , and hydrocephaly ) and in rabbits at 90 mg kg-1 day-1 ( including cardiovascular and renal anomalies , such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys , and diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia ) , in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The systemic exposure at these levels are approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .
Refer to section 4.6 .
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat , mouse , dog and monkey .
These effects occurred at systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant recipients .
Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended doses .
Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose ( systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure ) .
The nonclinical toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population ( see section 4.8 ) .

Myfenax 500 mg film-coated tablets
Each tablet contains 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1
Film-coated tablet ( tablet ) Pale purple , oval shaped film-coated tablet , debossed with &quot; M500 &quot; on one side and plain on the other side .
Myfenax tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area greater than 1.5 m2 , at a dose of 1 g twice daily ( 2 g daily dose ) .
As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group ( see section 4.8 ) compared with adults , temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required ; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction .
Adults : oral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation .
Children and adolescents : no data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients , therefore use in this patients group is not recommended until further data to support this is available .
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products , including Myfenax , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin ( see section 4.8 ) .
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and ultra-violet ( UV ) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The changes in MPAG ( the phenolic glucuronide of MPA ) pharmacokinetics ( MPAG increased by 8 % ) were minimal and are not considered clinically significant .
Sevelamer : decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12 by 30 % and 25 % , respectively , were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences ( i. e. graft rejection ) .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole : no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed .
Live vaccines : live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response .
The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Myfenax should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions , probably or possibly related to mycophenolate , reported in ≥ 1 / 10 and in ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 of patients treated with mycophenolate in the controlled clinical trials of renal ( 2 g data ) , cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are listed in the following table .
Within the system organ classes , undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency , using the following categories : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) . Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness
Blood and lymphatic system disorders
Leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , anaemia Pancytopenia , leukocytosis
Nervous system disorders
- Convulsion , hypertonia , tremor , somnolence , myasthenic syndrome , dizziness , headache , paraesthesia , dysgeusia
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders
Very common Common
- Pleural effusion , dyspnoea , cough
Vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , nausea Gastrointestinal haemorrhage , peritonitis , ileus , colitis , gastric ulcer , duodenal ulcer , gastritis , oesophagitis , stomatitis , constipation , dyspepsia , flatulence , eructation
- Renal impairment - Skin hypertrophy , rash , acne , alopecia
21
Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Agranulocytosis ( uncommon ) and neutropenia have been reported ; therefore regular monitoring of patients taking Myfenax is advised ( see section 4.4 ) . There have been reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow depression in patients treated with mycophenolate , some of which have been fatal .
Hypersensitivity : hypersensitivity reactions , including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported .
22 Congenital disorders : see further details in section 4.6 .
4.9 Overdose
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression ( see section 4.4 ) . If neutropenia develops , dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced ( see section 4.4 ) .
Orally administered radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose ; with 93 %
23 of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the faeces .
Most ( about 87 % ) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG .
In the early post-transplant period ( &lt; 40 days post-transplant ) , renal , cardiac and hepatic transplants patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30 % lower and Cmax approximately 40 % lower compared to the late post-transplant period ( 3 - 6 months post-transplant ) .
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate ( 1 g BID ) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol ( 0.02 mg to 0.04 mg ) and levonorgestrel ( 0.05 mg to 0.15 mg ) , desogestrel ( 0.15 mg ) or gestodene ( 0.05 mg to 0.10 mg ) conducted in 18 non-transplant women ( not taking other immunosuppressants ) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives .
24 In experimental models , mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic .
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 - 3 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day and 1.3 - 2 times the systemic exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day .
Two genotoxicity assays ( in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test ) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations .
The systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 - 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 - 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day in cardiac transplant patients .
The systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g / day for cardiac transplant patients .

4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Maintenance treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
FOR INTRAMUSCULAR USE ONLY .
DO NOT ADMINISTER INTRAVENOUSLY OR SUBCUTANEOUSLY .
( See section 4.4 )
ZYPADHERA should only be administered by deep intramuscular gluteal injection by a healthcare professional trained in the appropriate injection technique and in locations where postinjection observation and access to appropriate medical care in the case of overdose can be assured .
After each injection , patients should be observed in a health care facility by appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours for signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose .
It should be confirmed that the patient is alert , oriented , and absent of any signs and symptoms of overdose .
If an overdose is suspected , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until examination indicates that signs and symptoms have resolved ( See section 4.4 . ) .
Patients should be treated initially with oral olanzapine before administering ZYPADHERA , to establish tolerability and response .
For Instructions for Use , see section 6.6 .
Do not confuse ZYPADHERA 210 mg powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection with olanzapine 10 mg powder for solution for injection .
In order to identify the first ZYPADHERA dose for all patients the scheme in Table 1 should be considered .
2 Table 1
Recommended dose scheme between oral olanzapine and ZYPADHERA
Target Oral Dose 10 mg / day 15 mg / day 20 mg / day
Olanzapine Recommended Starting Dose of Maintenance Dose after 2 Months of ZYPADHERA ZYPADHERA Treatment 210 mg / 2 weeks or 405 mg / 4 weeks 150 mg / 2 weeks or 300 mg / 4 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks 210 mg / 2 weeks or 405 mg / 4 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks 300 mg / 2 weeks
Dose Adjustment Patients should be monitored carefully for signs of relapse during the first one to two months of treatment .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &quot; s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored during this period .
During treatment dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status .
After clinical reassessment dosage may be adjusted within the range 150 mg to 300 mg every 2 weeks or 300 to 405 mg every 4 weeks .
( Table 1 )
Supplementation Supplementation with oral olanzapine was not authorised in double-blind clinical studies .
If oral olanzapine supplementation is clinically indicated , then the combined total dose of olanzapine from both formulations should not exceed the corresponding maximum oral olanzapine dose of 20 mg / day .
Switching to other antipsychotic medicinal products There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from ZYPADHERA to other antipsychotic medicinal products .
Due to the slow dissolution of the olanzapine pamoate salt which provides a slow continuous release of olanzapine that is complete approximately six to eight months after the last injection , supervision by a clinician , especially during the first 2 months after discontinuation of ZYPADHERA , is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product and is considered medically appropriate .
Elderly patients ZYPADHERA has not been systematically studied in elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years ) .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended for treatment in the elderly population unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established .
A lower starting dose ( 150 mg / 4 weeks ) is not routinely indicated , but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended to be started in patients &gt; 75 years ( see section 4.4 ) .
Patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment Unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established in such patients , ZYPADHERA should not be used .
A lower starting dose ( 150 mg every 4 weeks ) should be considered for such patients .
In cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child- Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 150 mg every 4 weeks and only increased with caution .
Gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the dose .
When indicated , dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients .
3 ZYPADHERA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Special care must be taken to apply appropriate injection technique to avoid inadvertent intravascular or subcutaneous injection ( see section 6.6 ) .
Use in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state ZYPADHERA should not be used to treat patients with schizophrenia who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state such that immediate symptom control is warranted .
Post-injection syndrome During pre-marketing clinical studies , events that presented with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose , were reported in patients following an injection of ZYPADHERA .
These events occurred in &lt; 0.1 % of injections and approximately 1.4 % of patients . Most of these patients have developed symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
Other symptoms noted include extrapyramidal symptoms , dysarthria , ataxia , aggression , dizziness , weakness , hypertension and convulsion .
In most cases , initial signs and symptoms related to this event have appeared within 1 hour following injection , and in all cases full recovery was reported to have occurred within 24 - 72 hours after injection .
Events occurred rarely ( &lt; 1 in 1,000 injections ) between 1 and 3 hours , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 in 10,000 injections ) after 3 hours .
Patients should be advised about this potential risk and the need to be observed for 3 hours in a healthcare facility each time ZYPADHERA is administered .
Prior to giving the injection , the healthcare professional should determine that the patient will not travel alone to their destination .
After each injection , patients should be observed in a healthcare facility by appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours for signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose .
It should be confirmed that the patient is alert , oriented , and absent of any signs and symptoms of overdose .
If an overdose is suspected , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until examination indicates that signs and symptoms have resolved .
For the remainder of the day after injection , patients should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of overdose secondary to post injection adverse reactions , be able to obtain assistance if needed and should not drive or operate machinery ( see section 4.7 ) .
If parenteral benzodiazepines are essential for management of post injection adverse reactions , careful evaluation of clinical status for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression is recommended .
( see section 4.5 )
Injection Site Related Adverse Events The most commonly reported injection site related adverse event was pain .
The majority of these events was reported to be of &quot; mild &quot; to &quot; moderate &quot; severity .
In the event of an injection site related adverse event occuring , appropriate measures to manage these events should be taken .
( see section 4.8 )
Dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and / or behavioural disturbances and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients because of an increase
4 in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident . In placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 6-12 weeks duration ) of elderly patients ( mean age 78 years ) with dementia-related psychosis and / or disturbed behaviours , there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in oral olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo ( 3.5 % vs .
1.5 % , respectively ) .
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
However , the incidence of death was higher in oral olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with oral olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 % vs .
0.4 % , respectively ) .
All oral olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
Age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
In clinical trials , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo ( see section 4.8 ) , and oral olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
Oral olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
Rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with oral olanzapine .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
In some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ZYPADHERA , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia , and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight should be monitored regularly .
Lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ZYPADHERA , should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines .
5 Anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
However , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
Hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
Caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
In the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
In cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and / or neutrophil counts for any reason , in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia , in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression / toxicity , in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness , radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease .
Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
Discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) when oral olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral olanzapine , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
In clinical trials with olanzapine powder for solution for injection or ZYPADHERA , olanzapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT or in QTc intervals .
However , as with other antipsychotics , caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval , especially in the elderly , in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , heart hypertrophy , hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia .
Thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 % ) been reported .
A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
However , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
General CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
Seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
In most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
6 Tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
However the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
As with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
Studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
Long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
Use in elderly patients ( &gt; 75 years ) No information on the use of ZYPADHERA in patients &gt; 75 years is available .
Due to biochemical and physiological modification and reduction of muscular mass , this formulation is not recommended to be started in this sub-group of patients .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
Caution should be exercised in patients who receive medicinal products that can induce hypotension or sedation .
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
The clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non- smokers and 77 % male smokers .
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively .
A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
Fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found : tricyclic antidepressant ( representing
7 mostly CYP2D6 pathway ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 ) or diazepam ( CYP3A4 and 2C19 ) .
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
Nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
In a study of oral olanzapine in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
Mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
As olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day after each injection due to the possibility of a post-injection syndrome event leading to symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Post-injection syndrome events have occurred with ZYPADHERA leading to symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
Clinical signs and symptoms included symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
Other adverse reactions observed in patients treated with ZYPADHERA were similar to those seen with oral olanzapine .
In clinical trials with ZYPADHERA , the only adverse reaction reported at a statistically significantly higher rate in the ZYPADHERA group than in the placebo group was
8 sedation ( ZYPADHERA 8.2 % , placebo 2.0 % ) . Among all ZYPADHERA treated patients , sedation was reported by 4.7 % of patients .
In clinical trials with ZYPADHERA the incidence of injection site related adverse events was approximately 8 % .
The most commonly reported injection site related adverse event was pain ( 5 % ) ; some other injection site adverse events reported were ( in decreasing frequency ) : nodule type reactions , erythema type reactions , non-specific injection site reactions , irritation , oedema type reactions , bruising , haemorrhage , and anesthesia .
These events occurred in about 0.1 to 1.1 % of patients .
The undesirable effects listed below have been observed following administration of oral olanzapine but may occur following administration of ZYPADHERA .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
The following table lists the adverse reactions and laboratory investigations observed from spontaneous reporting and in clinical trials .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) , uncommon ( ≥ 0.1 % and &lt; 1 % ) , rare ( ≥ 0.01 % and &lt; 0.1 % ) , very rare ( &lt; 0.01 % ) , not known ( cannot be estimated from the data available ) .

Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
Patients gaining ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol / l ) .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( ≥ 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
10 4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) .
Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
In most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
In adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
Pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &quot; s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 % ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( ≥ 10 % ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
Speech disorder was also reported commonly .
During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 % of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
Long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline body weight in 39.9 % of patients .
Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
Clinically significant weight gain ( ≥ 7 % ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures . The
11 magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows : Very common ( ≥ 10 % ) , common ( ≥ 1 % and &lt; 10 % ) .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
Weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
Common :
Elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
Sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
Gastrointestinal disorders Common :
Dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
Elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
Decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and ≥ 15 % of baseline body weight was common .
With long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent patients gained ≥ 15 % and almost a third gained ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight .
Among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.016 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 1.016 mmol / l - &lt; 1.467 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 1.467 mmol / l ) .
11 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( ≥ 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( ≥ 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
12 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 % of adolescent patients .
4.9 Overdose
If signs and symptoms of overdose consistent with post injection syndrome are observed , appropriate supportive measures should be taken ( see section 4.4 ) .
While overdose is less likely with parenteral than oral medication , reference information for oral olanzapine overdose is presented below :
Signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 % incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute oral overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine .
Management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
12 and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
Do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
Cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : diazepines , oxazepines and thiazepines , ATC code N05A H03 .
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
In preclinical studies , olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities ( Ki ; &lt; 100 nM ) for serotonin 5-HT2A / 2C , 5-HT3 , 5-HT6 ; dopamine D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5 ; α -1 adrenergic ; and histamine H1 receptors .
Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
Olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5-HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
Unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
The effectiveness of ZYPADHERA in the treatment and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia is consistent with the established effectiveness of the oral formulation of olanzapine .
In a Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) study in patients treated with ZYPADHERA ( 300 mg / 4 weeks ) , mean D2 receptor occupancy was 60 % or higher at the end of a 6 month period , a level consistent with that found during treatment with oral olanzapine .
A total of 1469 patients with schizophrenia were included in 2 pivotal trials :
The first , an 8-week , placebo controlled trial conducted in adult patients ( n = 404 ) who were experiencing acute psychotic symptoms .
Patients were randomized to receive injections of ZYPADHERA 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , 210 mg every 2 weeks , or placebo every 2 weeks .
No oral antipsychotic supplementation was allowed .
Total Positive and Negative Symptom Scores ( PANSS ) showed significant improvement from baseline ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 101 ) to endpoint ( mean changes -22.57 , -26.32 , -22.49 respectively ) with each dose of ZYPADHERA ( 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , and 210 mg every 2 weeks ) as compared to placebo ( mean change -8.51 ) .
Visitwise mean change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS Total score indicated that by Day 3 , patients in the 300 mg / 2 weeks and 405 mg / 4 weeks treatment groups had statistically significantly greater reductions in PANSS Total score compared to placebo ( -8.6 , -8.2 , and -5.2 , respectively ) .
All 3 ZYPADHERA treatment groups showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo beginning by end of Week 1 .
These results support efficacy for ZYPADHERA over 8 weeks of treatment and a drug effect that was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with ZYPADHERA .
The second , a long term study in clinically stable patients ( n = 1065 ) ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 54.33 to 57.75 ) who were initially treated with oral olanzapine for 4 to 8 weeks and then switched to continue on oral olanzapine or to ZYPADHERA for 24 weeks .
No oral antipsychotic supplementation was allowed .
ZYPADHERA treatment groups of 150 mg and 300 mg given every 2 weeks ( doses pooled for analysis ) and 405 mg given every 4 weeks were non inferior to the combined doses of 10 , 15 and 20 mg of oral olanzapine ( doses pooled for analysis ) as measured by rates of
13 exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia ( respective exacerbation rates , 10 % , 10 % 7 % ) . Exacerbation was measured by worsening of items on the PANSS derived BPRS Positive scale and hospitalization due to worsening of positive psychotic symptoms .
The combined 150 mg and 300 mg / 2 week treatment group was non inferior to the 405 mg / 4 week treatment group ( exacerbation rates 10 % for each group ) at 24 weeks after randomisation .
Paediatric population ZYPADHERA has not been studied in the paediatric population .
The experience in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) is limited to short term oral olanzapine efficacy data in schizophrenia ( 6 weeks ) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder ( 3 weeks ) , involving less than 200 adolescents .
Oral olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
During treatment with oral olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
There are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Olanzapine is metabolised in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
The major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide .
Cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites ; both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent , olanzapine .
After a single IM injection with ZYPADHERA the slow dissolution of the olanzapine pamoate salt in muscle tissue begins immediately and provides a slow continuous release of olanzapine for more than four weeks .
The release becomes diminishingly smaller within eight to twelve weeks .
Antipsychotic supplementation is not required at the initiation of ZYPADHERA treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
The combination of the release profile and the dosage regimen ( IM injection every two or four weeks ) result in sustained olanzapine plasma concentrations .
Plasma concentrations remain measurable for several months after each ZYPADHERA injection .
The half-life of olanzapine after ZYPADHERA is 30 days compared to 30 hours following oral administration .
The absorption and elimination are complete approximately six to eight months after the last injection .
Oral olanzapine is rapidly distributed .
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine is about 93 % over the concentration range of 7 to about 1000 ng / mL .
In plasma , olanzapine is bound to albumin and α 1-acid glycoprotein .
Olanzapine plasma clearance after oral olanzapine is lower in females ( 18.9 l / hr ) versus males ( 27.3 l / hr ) , and in non-smokers ( 18.6 l / hr ) versus smokers ( 27.7 l / hr ) .
Similar pharmacokinetic differences between males and females and smokers and nonsmokers were observed in ZYPADHERA clinical trials .
However , the magnitude of the impact of gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
After repeated IM injections with 150 to 300 mg ZYPADHERA every two weeks , the 10th to 90th percentile of steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine were between 4.2 and 73.2 ng / ml .
The plasma concentrations of olanzapine observed across the dose range of 150mg every 4 weeks to 300mg every 2 weeks illustrate increased systemic olanzapine exposure with increased ZYPADHERA doses .
During the initial three months of treatment with ZYPADHERA , accumulation of olanzapine was observed but there was no additional accumulation during long-term use ( 12 months ) in patients who were injected with up to 300 mg every two weeks .
No specific investigations have been conducted in the elderly with ZYPADHERA .
ZYPADHERA is not recommended for treatment in the elderly population ( 65 years and over ) unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established .
In healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus
14 33.8 hours ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) . The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
In 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
In renally impaired patients ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml / min ) versus healthy subjects , there was no significant difference in mean elimination half-life ( 37.7 versus 32.4 hours ) or clearance ( 21.2 versus 25.0 l / hr ) .
A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
Although patients with renal impairment were not studied with ZYPADHERA , it is recommended that a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine is established in patients with renal impairment before treatment with ZYPADHERA is initiated ( see section 4.2 ) .
In smoking subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction , mean elimination half-life ( 39.3 hours ) of orally administered olanzapine was prolonged and clearance ( 18.0 l / hr ) was reduced analogous to non- smoking healthy subjects ( 48.8 hours and 14.1 l / hr , respectively ) .
Although patients with hepatic impairment were not studied with ZYPADHERA , it is recommended that a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine is established in patients with hepatic impairment before treatment with ZYPADHERA is initiated ( see section 4.2 ) .
In a study of oral olanzapine given to Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical safety studies were performed using olanzapine pamoate monohydrate .
The main findings found in repeat-dose toxicity studies ( rat , dog ) , in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study , and in toxicity to reproduction studies ( rat , rabbit ) were limited to injection site reactions for which no NOAEL could be determined .
No new toxic effect resulting from systemic exposure to olanzapine could be identified .
However , systemic concentrations in these studies were generally less than that seen at effect levels in the oral studies ; thus the information on oral olanzapine is provided below for reference .
Acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent antipsychotic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
The median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
Clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , laboured respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
In monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
Tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
Growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
Reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
Haematologic toxicity :
Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
Reversible neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg / kg / day ( total olanzapine exposure &#91; AUC &#93; is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12 mg dose ) .
In cytopenic dogs , there were no undesirable effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
15 Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
Sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
Oestrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg / kg ( 3 times the maximum human dose ) and reproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg / kg ( 9 times the maximum human dose ) .
In the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in foetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
Mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and oral in vivo mammalian tests .
Carcinogenicity Based on the results of oral studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

20 Table 1
Smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the dose .
These events occurred in &lt; 0.1 % of injections and approximately 1.4 % of patients . Most of these patients have developed symptoms of sedation ( ranging from mild in severity up to coma ) and / or delirium ( including confusion , disorientation , agitation , anxiety and other cognitive impairment ) .
If parenteral benzodiazepines are essential for management of post injection adverse reactions , careful evaluation of clinical status for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression is recommended .
In these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
QT interval In clinical trials with oral olanzapine , clinically meaningful QTc prolongations ( Fridericia QT correction &#91; QTcF &#93; ≥ 500 milliseconds &#91; msec &#93; at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF &lt; 500 msec ) were uncommon ( 0.1 % to 1 % ) in patients treated with olanzapine , with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo .
Due to biochemical and physiological modification and reduction of muscular mass , this formulation is not recommended to be started in this sub-group of patients .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
Adults The most frequently ( seen in ≥ 1 % of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence , weight gain , eosinophilia , elevated prolactin , cholesterol , glucose and triglyceride levels ( see section 4.4 ) , glucosuria , increased appetite , dizziness , akathisia , parkinsonism ( see section 4.4 ) , dyskinesia , orthostatic hypotension , anticholinergic effects , transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases ( see section 4.4 ) , rash , asthenia , fatigue and oedema .
28 4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( ≥ 7 mmol / l ) .
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 % of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
Total Positive and Negative Symptom Scores ( PANSS ) showed significant improvement from baseline ( baseline mean Total PANSS Score 101 ) to endpoint ( mean changes -22.57 , -26.32 , -22.49 respectively ) with each dose of ZYPADHERA ( 405 mg every 4 weeks , 300 mg every 2 weeks , and 210 mg every 2 weeks ) as compared to placebo ( mean change -8.51 ) .

Further information
WHAT ZYPADHERA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ZYPADHERA belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics and is used to treat schizophrenia - a disease with symptoms such as hearing , seeing or sensing things which are not there , mistaken beliefs , unusual suspiciousness , and becoming withdrawn .
People with this disease may also feel depressed , anxious or tense .
BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ZYPADHERA
You should not be given ZYPADHERA if you have : • an allergy ( hypersensitivity ) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients of ZYPADHERA .
An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash , itching , a swollen face , swollen lips or shortness of breath .
If this has happened to you , tell your nurse or doctor . • been previously diagnosed with eye problems such as certain kinds of glaucoma ( increased pressure in the eye ) .
Take special care with ZYPADHERA • Prior to giving ZYPADHERA , your doctor or nurse should determine that you will not travel alone to your destination after each injection . • An uncommon but serious reaction might occur after you receive each injection .
ZYPADHERA can sometimes enter the bloodstream too quickly .
If this happens , you may have the symptoms listed below after your injection .
In some cases , these symptoms can lead to unconsciousness .
• • • excessive sleepiness • confusion • irritability •
• • • •
